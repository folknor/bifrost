/// The paginated `*/changes` walk, shared by every state-based change

///
/// - the METHOD (`M`), which also supplies the diagnostic name
///   `ChangeWalkGuard` reports via `M::NAME`;
/// - `owner`, `Some(accountId)` only for a foreign (shared/delegate)
///   scope. It does two things at once, and both are why the parameter
///   exists rather than a flag: it qualifies every emitted change id into
///   the owning account's namespace (matching what the foreign inventory
///   mints - otherwise hydrating a changed foreign email routes through
///   the primary account), and it turns a permission denial into a
///   quarantine of this scope alone instead of a terminal account error.
///   With `owner: None` the error lane is exactly `into_account_error`,
///   which is what the primary walks always did;
/// - the per-`accountId` state cache (`states`) the scope advances -
///   Email and Mailbox states are separate JMAP `(accountId, type)`
///   positions and must not share a map.
///
/// The third walk over `*/changes` in this crate,
/// `discover::scope_lifecycle`, is deliberately NOT folded in here: it
/// emits `ScopeLifecycleEvent`s rather than `SyncEvent<Change>`, reads
/// each changed object back with a follow-up `Mailbox/get`, never
/// checkpoints, and lives for the account rather than for one walk. It
/// shares the part that is genuinely common - `ChangeWalkGuard` - and
/// nothing more. The inventory walk in `inventory.rs` is a different
/// shape again (query-then-get, anchored rather than state-based, with
/// its own re-served-anchor and superseded-`queryState` exits that end
/// WITHOUT a `Done`), so it too stays separate.
