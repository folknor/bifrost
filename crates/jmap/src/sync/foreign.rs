//! Foreign (shared/delegate) JMAP account codec.
//!
//! A non-personal JMAP account surfaces as ONE account-level cursor scope,
//! `CursorScope::Folder(encode_foreign_account(account_id))` - the same
//! `accountId\u{1f}` namespace with an empty mailbox part, because JMAP
//! `Email/changes` state is per `(accountId, type)` and cannot be
//! filtered by mailbox. Its individual mailboxes keep the two-part
//! `encode_foreign(account_id, mailbox_id)` form, which is the CONTAINER
//! and MEMBERSHIP namespace (`containers_list` native ids, qualified
//! `mailboxIds` on inventory and hydration), not a cursor scope. The
//! owning JMAP `accountId` rides inside the `FolderId` string so the
//! scope is self-routing on a cold cursor resume. `Type(_)` scopes
//! cannot carry a foreign account (`Type(Email)` is the same value for
//! every account, so identical scopes for different accounts would
//! collide in the engine's cursor / membership index); the `Folder`
//! shape is the variant-free resolution.
//!
//! Identical in shape to the Graph codec but per-crate: here the
//! `mailbox` field is a JMAP `accountId` and `folder` is a native JMAP
//! mailbox id, where Graph carries a `/users/{id}` routing key - so a
//! shared `bifrost-types` type would be a false generalization.
