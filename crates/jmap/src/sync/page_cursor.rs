//! The anchored, state-pinned page cursor shared by the contact and calendar
//! page walks (`ContactCard/query`, `CalendarEvent/query`).
//!
//! Everything here is protocol mechanics that is identical for every object
//! type: the `2:` payload, anchor paging, the `queryState` pin, the
//! termination rules, the `anchorNotFound` mapping and the error
//! classifications. What varies per object type is a [`PageKind`]: the id
//! marker, the query-builder type, how a query is pointed at its start or at
//! an anchor, and the diagnostic wording. Nothing about behaviour is a kind
//! parameter - two kinds cannot disagree on termination, on an absent
//! `total`, or on error classification.
//!
//! Callers implement `PageKind` on a unit struct and call the provided
//! associated functions, e.g. `ContactPages::next_cursor(..)`.
//!
//! The encoded form is persisted by consumers, so it is frozen: `2:` followed
//! by a JSON two-element array `[anchor, queryState]`.
