/// Flattens one decoded state-lane payload into the notifications it
/// actually carries.
///
/// A push payload may be a `Group` whose `entries` are themselves push
/// objects, so a group's state changes are exactly as authoritative as a
/// top-level one - and dropping them is the precise loss the state-teardown
/// rule in `event_source` exists to prevent, minus the teardown that would
/// at least have replayed them. The WebSocket lane already recurses
/// through groups (`sync/push.rs::emit_push`); this is the same traversal,
/// written with an explicit worklist because the nesting depth is chosen by
/// the server. Entries are pushed in reverse so they pop in wire order.
///
/// One SSE block yields at most ONE `StateChange`, because the block has
/// exactly one resume token. Emitting a state change per nested entry gave
/// them all the same `id`, so a consumer that processed and checkpointed
/// the first one and then stopped resumed AFTER the whole block and lost
/// every entry it had not reached. Every state change in the block is
/// therefore MERGED into one notification carrying that single id, which
/// makes the token atomic by construction.
///
/// The merge is over the INNER maps: `changed` is per account and then per
/// data type, so `A -> {Email: e1}` followed by `A -> {Mailbox: m1}` must
/// yield `A -> {Email: e1, Mailbox: m1}`; replacing the account's map would
/// lose data. Later wins only for the same `(account, data type)` pair, and
/// "later" means later in depth-first traversal order - state strings are
/// opaque and are never compared to decide recency. Coalescing is expressly
/// permitted by RFC 8620 s7, and no `Group` guarantee requires a consumer to
/// observe intermediate states.
///
/// Ordering is the load-bearing half. Alerts are emitted FIRST, in their
/// wire-order relative sequence, and the merged state change LAST. An alert
/// carries no token of its own, so it cannot be lost by teardown alone - but
/// if the checkpoint-bearing state change came first and were checkpointed,
/// a disconnect before the following alert would skip that alert on resume.
/// Putting the token-bearing notification after everything else in the block
/// means interrupted processing can only replay, never skip.
///
/// An EMPTY `StateChange` present in the block still yields a notification:
/// its id can advance the consumer's checkpoint even though it names no
/// change.
///
/// A `CalendarAlert` reaching the state lane is forwarded rather than
/// dropped: the payload's own discriminator is its `@type` field, and a
/// server is free to carry an alert in a default-typed block or inside a
/// group instead of under `event: calendarAlert`.
///
/// `EmailPush` is forwarded as its own notification, for the same ordering
/// reason and one more. Dropping it was silent loss: when the block also
/// carries a state change, that state change commits the block's resume token
/// and the discarded object is never replayed. It cannot be folded into the
/// merged `StateChange` either - it carries no state string, a synthesised one
/// would be a lie about a checkpoint position, and an empty `Changes` means
/// "no changed type" rather than "reconcile everything". Like an alert it is
/// token-free, so it is emitted BEFORE the merged state change.

        // A parser error ends it, but NOT because the framing is

        // a block carrying state - and the parser reports only "too long",
        // not whether the discarded block held a state change. Continuing
        // would hand the consumer the NEXT event with the next checkpoint,
        // letting it resume past a state change that was silently dropped:
        // the same loss the state-teardown rule below exists to prevent.

        // Exempting a "content-free" overflow - letting a pathological
        // comment line be reported without ending the stream - was tried
        // and rejected, so do not rebuild it. The verdict is not computable
        // where the error is raised: the cap trips mid-block, and the block
        // is not over. In

        //     :<more than 1 MiB>
        //     data: {"@type":"StateChange", ...}
        //
        // no data has been seen when the comment trips the cap, so the
        // overflow looks content-free - and then `discard(..)` eats the
        // rest of the block, `data:` line included. The same holds for an
        // oversized `event:`/`id:`/unknown field name ahead of a valid
        // `data:` line, and for a block whose remainder arrives in a later
        // frame. Deferring the verdict to the terminating blank line is
        // strictly more machinery than the case is worth: `discard(..)`
        // also swallows a later `id:`, so "no data lost" is narrower than
        // "continuation preserves parser semantics" and the next event
        // would carry a stale resume token; the blank line may never
        // arrive, turning an immediately reportable error into an
        // indefinitely pending read that needs its own budget and EOF
        // policy; and the EOF branch below exits without asking the parser
        // whether an overflow is pending, so frame exhaustion would be read
        // as proof of a safely completed block. All of that buys exactly
        // one thing: surviving a comment line over 1 MiB, which no
        // interoperability requirement asks for.
        //
        // An undecodable `EventType::State` payload ends it because the
        // payload was authoritative. Skipping it silently loses the state
        // change it carried and leaves the client believing it is caught up;
        // the reconnect costs a round trip but replays that change from
        // `lastEventId`, so teardown is how the change is recovered rather
        // than a way of punishing the server.
        //
        // An undecodable `EventType::CalendarAlert` is skipped, and NOT
        // because anything later repairs it. An alert reports that a
        // notification FIRED - a transient delivery event - so re-reading
        // calendar object state does not reproduce it and the alert is simply
        // lost. Terminating cannot recover it either: the same build would run
        // the same deterministic decode over the same bytes, and this stream
        // has no retry counter, no quarantine and no fallback, so a reconnect
        // that replays the block tears down again. (RFC 8620 s7.3 describes
        // resending missed state changes, not a byte-for-byte event log, so a
        // server COULD regenerate the block differently - that is not a
        // mechanism anything can depend on.) Termination therefore recovers
        // nothing while costing the consumer every SUBSEQUENT notification
        // indefinitely, letting one non-authoritative payload livelock the
        // whole push lane, mail state changes included. So: this alert could
        // not be delivered; report that loss and continue, so it does not
        // indefinitely obstruct unrelated notifications. Later reconciliation
        // does not repair it. The error is yielded before the skip, so the
        // consumer is told the loss happened.
        //
        // `EventType::Unknown` is never decoded at all, so it cannot reach
        // either rule. See the variant's own documentation for why an
        // unrecognised event name is inert rather than authoritative.
