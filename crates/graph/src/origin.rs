//! Which URLs may carry the account bearer.
//!
//! `bifrost-net` attaches the token source's bearer to the FIRST request of
//! every call, whatever its host; its trusted-host allowlist and
//! `Authorization` stripping apply only to redirect hops. So every URL this
//! crate sends a bearer-carrying request to must already be known to sit on
//! the origin the token was configured for. This module is where that is
//! decided, and the only place.
//!
//! The rule is exact origin equality with the configured base (scheme, host
//! and port, default ports normalized by the URL parser), with no userinfo in
//! the authority. A URL the crate did not build - a caller's page cursor, a
//! persisted delta link, a server's `@odata.nextLink`, an Autodiscover
//! `RedirectUrl` - reaches the wire only as an [`AdmittedUrl`], and the only
//! way to get one is [`Base::admit`]. Graph documents its links as complete
//! URLs on the service root that issued them, and a national cloud is a
//! separately configured base, so a link on any other origin is not followed.
//!
//! The one URL that may leave for another origin is a OneDrive upload
//! session URL, which never carries the bearer; it is admitted here too, under
//! its own rule ([`Base::admit_upload`]), and reaches the wire only as an
//! [`UploadUrl`].
//!
//! Server links arrive as [`ProviderLink`], which deliberately has no
//! accessor that yields a requestable string: the compiler, not review,
//! stops one from being followed, minted into a caller cursor, or persisted
//! into a checkpoint without admission.
