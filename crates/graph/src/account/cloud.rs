//! OneDrive large-attachment hosting: resumable upload + sharing link.
//!
//! COPY-AND-ADAPTed from ratatoskr's `graph/onedrive.rs`. The pure pieces
//! (serde structs, `encode_onedrive_path`, the chunk-range math) copy cleanly;
//! the transport bodies are rewritten onto bifrost-net. The ratatoskr source
//! used `reqwest::Client` directly for the chunk PUT and threaded a
//! `db: &ReadDbState` ratatoskr handle into the session/link `client.post`
//! calls; the rewrite drops both. The session/link POSTs route through
//! `GraphClient::post` (AccountNet supplies the Bearer); the pre-authenticated
//! chunk PUTs and the session cancel go through `GraphClient::execute_aux`
//! with `AuxTarget::Anonymous`, which carries no bearer and follows no
//! redirect.
//!
//! De-brand: ratatoskr uploaded into a `"Ratatoskr Attachments"` folder. This
//! uses a neutral, consumer-agnostic `"Attachments"` folder. A future
//! consumer-configurable folder name can replace `ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER` without
//! touching the wire path.
//!
//! Mailbox routing: hosting always uploads into the *primary* user's OneDrive
//! (`account.client`, the `/me/drive` prefix), even when the draft being
//! composed belongs to a shared/delegate mailbox (`send_as`). This is
//! deliberate - a shared Exchange mailbox has no OneDrive of its own, and the
//! attachment is shared via a link rather than embedded, so the authenticated
//! user's drive is the only sensible host. The recipient sees a link, not a
//! drive location, so the hosting mailbox is invisible downstream.
