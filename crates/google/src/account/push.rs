/// mailbox has. Two live `GoogleAccount` instances for one mailbox therefore
/// share one remote watch - and the sync engine's reopen creates exactly that
/// pair, subscribing on the replacement BEFORE it tears down the old
/// account's handle. Without coordination the old account's teardown
/// `users.stop` kills the replacement's fresh watch, and push stays silently
/// dead until the next renewal, up to six days later (the abort path of the

///
/// `holders` counts the actors in this process that currently own a live
/// watch on the mailbox; a teardown sends `users.stop` only when no OTHER
/// holder exists. `exchange` serializes every `users.watch` and `users.stop`
/// for the mailbox across instances, so a stop decided on a zero count
/// cannot reach Gmail after another instance's watch that the count did not
/// yet show.
///
/// The bias is deliberate: a watch nobody stops is cheap (it expires within
/// seven days, and a notification with no listener is dropped), a watch
/// stopped under a live listener is expensive (push is silently dead). Every
/// ambiguity - a holder released late, a second consumer in the process
/// using another topic - errs toward skipping the stop. Instances in OTHER
/// processes are invisible here; `users.stop` gives no way to scope to a
/// watch, so that residual cannot be closed on this side.
