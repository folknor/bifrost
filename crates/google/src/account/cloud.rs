//! Google Drive large-attachment hosting: resumable upload + sharing link.
//!
//! COPY-AND-ADAPTed from ratatoskr's `gmail/gdrive.rs`. The pure pieces (serde
//! structs, chunk-range math, the scope vocabulary) copy cleanly; the transport
//! bodies are rewritten onto bifrost-net's `RequestBuilder`/`Response` - no bare
//! `reqwest::Client`, no hand-built `Authorization: Bearer` headers (the
//! AccountNet token source supplies them; the pre-authenticated chunk PUT skips
//! auth with `.without_bearer_auth()`).
//!
//! The whole flow is one call: upload the bytes via the resumable session, then
//! create a sharing permission and read the `webViewLink`. It returns only when
//! both steps succeed; a stray uploaded-but-unlinked file is the worst failure
//! mode, so a failed link step after a successful upload is still an `Err`.
//!
//! The UPLOAD step has an equivalent, and it is handled here rather than left to
//! the consumer. A resumable session is server-side state created before the
//! first byte is sent, and Drive holds an incomplete one for about a week. Any
//! failure between `create_upload_session` and a completed upload therefore
//! leaves a partial upload behind, so the upload step cancels its own session on
//! the way out (`DELETE` against the session URI) before returning the original
//! error. Cancellation is one bounded, un-retried request whose own failure is
//! swallowed: it must never replace or delay the error the caller actually needs.
//!
//! Two things this deliberately does NOT do. It does not reclassify the failure
//! as `Protocol(PartialResponse)` / `Acknowledged` the way the cross-calendar
//! event move does - that vocabulary says "the first leg landed and a consumer
//! can go look at the target", and here there is no target: Drive publishes no
//! file until the upload completes, so a `CheckTarget` / `DedupeByClientId`
//! directive would send a consumer looking for something that provably does not
//! exist, and would demote a transient transport failure out of the retry lane
//! it belongs in. It also does not resume the session on a later call: the
//! session URI is per-call state that no `HostAttachment` request carries back
//! in, so resumption would require a published surface change.
//!
//! Where cancellation itself fails, the returned `AccountError` is decorated
//! with support-only text saying the session was left behind, so a support
//! export can tell "cleaned up" from "expires in a week". The decoration goes
//! through `into_builder`, which preserves the kind and hence the recovery
//! class. The session URI is pre-authenticated and is deliberately NOT written
//! into that text.
//!
//! Residual, accepted: a caller who drops the returned future mid-upload gets no
//! cancellation at all, because a `Drop` impl cannot await. The alternative - a
//! guard that spawns the DELETE from `drop` - trades an expiring server-side
//! session for a detached task outliving the account handle, which is a worse
//! leak in a crate whose shutdown story is the caller dropping the future.
//!
//! The chunk PUTs and the cancel DELETE go to the pre-authenticated session URI
//! with redirects disabled per request (`FollowRedirects::Disabled`), so every
//! 3xx comes back to this module as a plain response and nothing is ever sent
//! to a `Location`. Drive's 308 Resume Incomplete carries a `Range` header and
//! NO `Location`, so it reaches the chunk loop as progress; a 3xx that DOES
//! carry a `Location` is a real redirect the resumable protocol never uses, and
//! is refused as `Protocol(ContractViolation)` without echoing the `Location`.
//! A redirected cancel is reported as an abandoned session.
//!
//! Byte accounting: these are the only Gmail-crate requests that do NOT go
//! through `GmailClient::send_recorded`, so they are not enrolled in the
//! per-batch `ByteTally` the sync and mutation streams publish. That
//! under-reports nothing, because Drive uploads are a PIM call and feed no
//! `bytes_in` field at all - they are not an engine batch. Recorded here so a
//! byte-accounting audit does not re-file it as a metering hole; the general
//! claim that every request-bearing lane is metered is about the batch-emitting
//! producers, which this is not.
//!
//! Audit boundary: the 2026-07 google bug sweep did NOT line-audit this
//! module; it was skipped as already test-dense. A later auditor should read
//! it fresh rather than assuming that sweep covered it.
