//! A provider stream that neither yields nor ends must not park its driver.
//!
//! The shape these pin is a wedge, not a slow server: `changes_stream` returns
//! a stream whose next poll is `Pending` forever. Before the poll arms landed,
//! `drive_changes_stream` sat on that poll with no arm at all, and the cost was
//! not the bounded `detach_timeout` the item was filed under. Per-scope poll
//! tasks are spawned with their `JoinHandle` discarded, so a wedged drive is
//! not among the workers `detach` waits on: it cost detach nothing and SURVIVED
//! it, holding an `Arc<dyn Account>`, a scheduler admission and a
//! `ChangeDelivery`, still able to publish into a `PendingCoverage` nobody
//! owned. `SyncControl::pause` was wedged by the same stream, because the
//! drive's activity guard is held across the poll.
//!
//! Every test here would hang rather than fail without the arm, so each one is
//! wrapped in a timeout: the assertion IS promptness.
