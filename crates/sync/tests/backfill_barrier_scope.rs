//! End-to-end pin for A2's final shape: a barrier stops the SCOPE walk
//! through the REAL orchestrator, not just inside `ScopeWalkDriver`.
//!
//! Round 3 unit-tested the driver because no reusable `Account` double
//! existed; this file drives the whole pipeline - attach, cursor
//! establishment, the backfill orchestrator's fixed-plan loop, the partition
//! runner, the broadcast channel - against `common::StubAccount`, and pins
//! the properties that were each separately gotten wrong during the arc:
//!
//! - the partition after a barrier is never even REQUESTED from the account;
//! - the barrier page's items are delivered with its checkpoint STRIPPED;
//! - no completion sentinel is broadcast for the stopped scope;
//! - nothing becomes durable without a consumer ack.
