//! A pause landing around a scope repair must not lose the scope.
//!
//! `RestartScope` (and `DowngradeCapabilityForScope`, which ends in the same
//! repair) deletes the scope's in-memory and durable cursor and then
//! re-establishes it. The establishment refuses a paused account, and the
//! multiplexer only polls scopes still present in the cursor registry, so a
//! pause landing between the delete and the establishment stranded the scope for
//! good: after `resume_account` nothing ever raised a directive for it again.
//!
//! Two shapes, one per half of the fix:
//!
//! - the account is already paused when the dispatch reaches the repair: nothing
//!   may be deleted, and the still-registered failing cursor re-raises the
//!   directive after resume;
//! - a pause lands while the repair is running (during the backoff between two
//!   establishment attempts): the pause waits for the bounded repair, and the
//!   retry is not refused by the boundary the pause just flipped.
//!
//! Both run under a paused clock, so the recovery backoff and the poll cadence
//! are virtual and "let everything settle" is a plain sleep.
