//! The scope fence, read at the seam a WALK crosses rather than at the seam a
//! PAGE crosses.
//!
//! `run_partition` re-reads the fence around its capacity park, which catches a
//! reset that closes while a page is in the producer's hand. It cannot catch a
//! reset that closes while the producer is BETWEEN partitions, because the
//! reading it would compare against is taken after the reset - the new
//! incarnation's fence compared with itself. The walk's later partitions then
//! publish above the fence, and a consumer acknowledges them in good faith,
//! rewriting the very rows a `delete_backfill: true` reset had just removed.
//!
//! Staging that needs a park point with NO page in hand and NO pre-reset fence
//! reading, and the account pause is exactly one: `run_partition` holds the
//! control's activity guard for its whole pass, so a `pause()` that returns has
//! proved the producer is parked at the top of the next partition rather than
//! mid-page. The trigger is a provider folder DELETION, because it purges the
//! scope's durable rows in full and drops the scope from the registry - so any
//! row or page appearing afterwards can only have come from the walk that
//! should have stopped.
//!
//! Current-thread runtime with `start_paused`, like the rest of the lane tests:
//! no wall-clock sleeps, and "nothing more was published" is an observation
//! about an idle runtime rather than a wall-clock guess.
