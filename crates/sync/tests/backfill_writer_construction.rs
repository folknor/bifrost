//! An external consumer must still be able to CONSTRUCT the published backfill
//! checkpoint helper.
//!
//! The round-3 reshape replaced `BackfillCheckpointWriter::store`'s bare
//! `Arc<DynCheckpointStore>` with an opaque target, which is what closes the
//! lost-update race against the account's in-memory debt ledger. A published
//! type nobody outside the crate can build is removed in substance even though
//! its name survives, so both routes stay open: the safe one through an
//! attached engine, and the direct-store one external code already had.
//!
//! This file lives outside the crate on purpose - it compiles against exactly
//! the surface a downstream consumer sees.
