//! A strategy downgrade actually restarts the account.
//!
//! `EngineDirective::DowngradeStrategy` is derived from a
//! `SyncState(StrategyFailure)` error and handled by restarting the account,
//! then, when the error names a cursor scope, re-establishing that scope. The
//! recovery dispatch takes the slot's `reopen_lock` for scope-local repairs,
//! and `open_replacement` takes the same non-reentrant mutex for the open and
//! the swap. Holding it across the dispatch of a directive that restarts the
//! account therefore hung recovery forever on the first downgrade, with no
//! error and nothing logged.
//!
//! The staging is built so that only a COMPLETED restart satisfies the
//! assertions. The first account terminates its scope's change stream with the
//! downgrade error exactly once; the replacement account never fails. A hung
//! recovery leaves the factory unopened a second time, the first account
//! unclosed, and the replacement never asked to establish anything, so every
//! observation below is false under the hang. Each wait is bounded by a
//! timeout well under the watchdog, so the hang shows up as a failed assertion
//! rather than a stuck suite.
