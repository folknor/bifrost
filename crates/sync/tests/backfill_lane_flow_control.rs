//! End-to-end pins for the bounded backfill lane (`engine::lane`).
//!
//! Cold-start pages and live changes share one broadcast ring with no
//! producer-side backpressure of its own. Backfill now takes one lane permit per
//! published page and returns it once the consumer acknowledges that page (or
//! any later one) through the ack writer, so a slow consumer applies flow
//! control instead of losing pages to ring overflow and re-reading from the last
//! durable checkpoint.
//!
//! These drive the whole pipeline against `common::StubAccount` - attach, the
//! orchestrator's fixed-plan loop, the partition runner, the broadcast, the ack
//! writer - because every one of the properties below is a property of that
//! assembly rather than of the bound itself, which has its own unit tests.
//!
//! Every test here runs on the CURRENT-THREAD runtime with `start_paused`. That
//! is deliberate and is not a weaker choice: a current-thread runtime interleaves
//! tasks at every await, and paused time additionally advances only once every
//! task is idle - which turns "the walk stopped and stayed stopped" into a
//! deterministic observation instead of a wall-clock guess, and makes "the
//! spawned waiter has parked" a fact rather than a hope. There are no wall-clock
//! sleeps anywhere in this file; the `sleep` calls are virtual.
//!
//! None of these tests is a concurrency race test. The cross-task ordering
//! properties live in `multiplexer::tests`, on a multi-threaded runtime.
