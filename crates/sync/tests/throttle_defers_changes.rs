//! A recorded throttle deadline actually defers `changes_stream`.
//!
//! The throttle bucket's mechanics are unit-pinned in `recovery.rs` - key
//! resolution, max-of-overlapping records, membership, expiry. None of that
//! proves the engine OBSERVES a deadline: the recorder and the reader could
//! both be correct and still never meet, because the reader ran on a
//! different clock from the timer that retired the wait. That is exactly what
//! was wrong until `ThrottleBucket` moved to `tokio::time::Instant`; with
//! `SystemTime` deadlines and a `tokio::time::sleep` retiring them, a run
//! under paused time re-derived the full wait after every sleep and spun
//! forever.
//!
//! Both tests are staged so that ONLY the shared bucket can explain what they
//! observe:
//!
//! - The scope under observation NEVER fails. It has no retry advice of its
//!   own, so the drive loop's local `retry_delay` sleep - the other timer in
//!   this path, and the one that could otherwise fake the result - cannot
//!   apply to it. The scope that does fail is a different one.
//! - The assertion is not "total elapsed time looks about right". It is a
//!   poll COUNT over a window many cadences wide (flat), followed by the same
//!   count RESUMING once the deadline passes. Flat alone would also be
//!   satisfied by a hang; resumption at the deadline is what makes it a
//!   deferral.
