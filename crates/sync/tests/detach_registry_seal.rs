//! Every write to the push registry is sealed against detach.
//!
//! Detach cancels the slot's shutdown token BEFORE it takes and discards the
//! account's registry entry, and it does not wait for consumer-driven work. A
//! registry write that lands after that take sits under an id a later `attach`
//! of the same `AccountId` inherits, and is handed to the provider as if live.
//! The orphan restores were sealed first (`detach_orphan_race`); these cover the
//! two writes that were not: a consumer's `subscribe_push` registering its
//! handle, and a reattach commit installing the replacement's handles.
//!
//! Sealing the write is half of each fix. The subscription the refused write
//! names is LIVE on the provider, so each case also asserts it was torn down
//! rather than dropped on the floor.
//!
//! Both stage detach with the park gates: the write is held at the point just
//! before it happens, detach runs to completion, and only then is the gate
//! released.
