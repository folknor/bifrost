//! A wedged `inventory_partition_stream` must not park the backfill runner.
//!
//! Same shape as the changes-drive wedge, different signal: the runner selects
//! the account shutdown token it already reaches through its `LaneGate`, rather
//! than the boundary. What makes this one delicate is not the arm but the
//! OUTCOME. A cancelled partition must never report `complete: true` or
//! `RequestNextPartition`, because the orchestrator would then write a
//! completion sentinel and the next attach would skip the scope entirely -
//! silent data invisibility, not re-work. Returning `Error::ShuttingDown`
//! sidesteps the question by reporting no outcome at all.
