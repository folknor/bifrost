//! An orphan must not land in the registry after detach has taken it.
//!
//! A push handle whose server-side delete was refused is registered as an orphan
//! so a later reopen or `unsubscribe_push` can retry it. `detach` discards the
//! account's registry entry, and a later `attach` of the same `AccountId` starts
//! from whatever is registered under it, handing it to the provider as if live.
//! Detach cancels the slot's shutdown token BEFORE it takes the entry, but it
//! does not wait for consumer-driven reattaches, so an orphan written by one
//! that is still unwinding lands after the take unless the write itself observes
//! the teardown.
//!
//! The staging uses the park gates to place detach squarely between an aborting
//! reattach's cleanup delete and the write of its refusal.
