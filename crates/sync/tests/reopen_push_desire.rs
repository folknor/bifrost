//! A reopen must keep the consumer's push subscriptions alive across a failed
//! old-side teardown.
//!
//! Reopen recreates every registered subscription on the replacement and then
//! tears the old handles down on the old account. When one of those teardowns
//! fails (a Graph 503 on the DELETE, a JMAP socket that died), the attempt
//! aborts and the record is flagged `teardown_unconfirmed` so the next attempt
//! does not abort on it again. That flag used to double as "orphan, never
//! recreate", so the next attempt tore the old handle down (or carried it) and
//! recreated nothing: the subscription the consumer still wanted vanished with
//! no error anywhere. Whether the old handle's teardown is confirmed and
//! whether the consumer still wants the coverage are two separate facts, and
//! these tests pin both halves.
