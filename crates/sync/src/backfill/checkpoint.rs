//! Backfill checkpoint writer.
//!
//! The runner emits a `BackfillCheckpoint` at every partition boundary and a
//! finer-grained partial checkpoint at each `Batch` boundary inside a
//! partition. This module wraps the `CheckpointStore` calls so the runner
//! doesn't need to know the persistence shape.

/// through the account's single writer task, which owns the authoritative debt
/// ledger in memory; that is the only route with no lost update, because a
/// helper that reads the ledger itself, awaits, and writes it back will clobber
/// whatever the writer committed in between. `direct` is the older
/// read-modify-write shape against a bare store, preserved because it is what
/// externally-constructed writers had before the writer task existed - it
/// carries that race and is not what an attached engine should use.
