//! Scope-level partition sequencing for the backfill orchestrator.
//!
//! # Why this is not a loop variable
//!
//! A barrier region is a property of the SCOPE, not of the partition that
//! happened to run into it: the region cannot be represented and cannot be
//! replayed, so any later partition's checkpoint certifies a prefix that
//! crosses it. Stopping the partition is therefore only half the rule, and the
//! half that used to be missing was the expensive one - both orchestrator loops
//! read a stopped partition as "merely degraded" and went straight on to the
//! next fixed partition or page window, handing checkpoints out beyond the
//! barrier exactly as if the stop had never happened.
//!
//! The loops no longer own that decision. They ask this driver for the next
//! partition and fold each outcome back into it, so a walk that stopped simply
//! has no next partition to hand out. There is no flag for a loop to forget to
//! check.
