//! Backfill partition runner.
//!
//! Walks `inventory_partition_stream(scope)` and forwards each `Batch`
//! as a `MultiplexerEvent` carrying `Change::ObjectChange::Created`
//! items plus a `BackfillCheckpoint` checkpoint. The runner filters
//! each page through `LiveSupersedes`, which is intentionally never
//! populated - see that type's docs for why "we broadcast it" is not
//! evidence the consumer received it, and what a sound producer would
//! have to prove first.
//!
//! ## Checkpoint-durability contract
//!
//! Durable persistence is consumer-ack-deferred, mirroring
//! `drive_changes_stream`. The runner broadcasts each page and its
//! `BackfillCheckpoint` but does NOT write to `CheckpointStore`. The
//! consumer atomically persists the page items in their own store, then
//! calls `SyncEngine::ack_checkpoint` with the `Checkpoint::Backfill`;
//! the per-account ack writer routes that to
//! `CheckpointStore::put_backfill` and fires `record_checkpoint` to wake
//! pause / checkpoint waiters on a durable boundary.
//!
//! This closes the at-least-once gap an eager engine-side write would
//! open: a crash between broadcast and the consumer's write re-walks the
//! partition on restart (the orchestrator always restarts a scope from
//! its first partition), so no inventory page is lost. An eager write
//! would let the store record progress the consumer never durably
//! persisted, permanently losing that page's objects on cold start.

/// `BackfillRunner::run_partition` filters against it, but no producer
/// calls `add`, so it filters nothing. That is a considered decision,
/// not an oversight, and wiring the multiplexer or push reconciler into
/// it re-introduces silent data loss. Two independent reasons:
///
/// 1. **Broadcasting is not receiving.** The per-account channel is a
///    `tokio::broadcast`. The slot holds a sentinel receiver, so `send`
///    reports success even when no consumer is attached; a subscriber
///    that arrives later starts at the ring's tail and never sees
///    earlier values; and a subscriber that lags has values overwritten
///    out from under it, which this crate does not detect or replay.
///    Recording an id on `send` therefore records ids the consumer will
///    never receive - and suppressing the inventory copy of one of
///    those is permanent loss of that object for the session, because
///    the in-memory cursor has already advanced past it.
///
/// 2. **Selection and publication are separate operations.** Even with
///    a correct record trigger, backfill decides to keep an entry and
///    broadcasts it much later. A live change landing in that gap is
///    recorded too late to suppress anything, so the runner still
///    emits a `Created` for an object the live stream just destroyed.
///    Any working design has to make "decide + publish" indivisible for
///    a given id on both sides.
///
/// The only sound record trigger this engine has is the consumer ack:
/// `SyncEngine::ack_checkpoint` is what the crate already treats as
/// proof of receipt, precisely because broadcast delivery is not. A
/// correct implementation buffers ids as pending, keyed by the
/// checkpoint of the batch carrying them, and promotes them to
/// suppressing only once that checkpoint is acked - with a policy for
/// batches whose `checkpoint` is `None`, since those can never be
/// promoted, and a bound on the pending buffer.
///
/// That is worth building only if the duplicate is expensive, and it is
/// not: consumers must already tolerate a repeated `Created`, because a
/// crash mid-plan re-walks every partition and re-emits acked pages
/// (see the module docs). An unpopulated set costs duplicates the
/// consumer already absorbs. A wrongly populated one drops mail.
