//! Safe-boundary primitive.
//!
//! The engine drives long streams through workers that emit `Batch`s
//! with checkpoints. Pause / checkpoint_now / hard-stop semantics
//! depend on the worker stopping cleanly at a `Batch` boundary - never
//! mid-page - so the checkpoint persists alongside the data.
//!
//! `BoundaryRequest` is a `tokio::sync::watch` value workers peek
//! before pulling the next batch from their underlying stream. The
//! engine flips the request from `Run` to `Pause` / `CheckpointNow` /
//! `Stop` via the `Control` surface; the worker reacts at the next
//! safe boundary.
