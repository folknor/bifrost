//! `SyncEngine` lifecycle.
//!
//! Holds an `Arc<dyn AccountFactory>` per attached account, drives one
//! multiplexer / backfill / push reconciler / mutation pipeline per
//! slot, and exposes the engine's public surface: `attach`, `detach`,
//! `account_changes_stream`, `bulk_*` campaign entry points, the
//! read-only hydration passthrough (`get_stream`, `message_hydrate`,
//! `open_blob`, `open_raw_rfc822`, ...), `invalidation_sink`.
//!
//! `SyncEngine` itself lives here, along with the builder, the slot
//! lifecycle (`detach`, `reattach`, `shutdown`), the consumer-facing ack
//! and debt surface, and `Drop`. Its remaining methods are split by
//! concern across sibling modules, each of which adds its own
//! `impl SyncEngine` block:
//!
//! - `attach` - scope discovery, cursor establishment, the worker spawn
//!   block, and the deferred-inventory worker.
//! - `backfill` - the backfill orchestrator: rescan, resume planning,
//!   and the per-partition walk.
//! - `ack` - the account's single durable writer and `WriterHandle`.
//! - `reattach` - recovery dispatch: reattach, restart, re-establish,
//!   and the engine-directive arms.
//! - `bulk` - the bulk mutation pipeline and its campaign entry points.
//! - `passthrough` - the read-only hydration and PIM forwarders.
//! - `context` - `SlotContext`, the handle bundle the spawned workers
//!   share.
//! - `lane` - the bounded backfill lane: producer-side flow control so a
//!   cold start cannot outrun a consumer into the broadcast ring.
//!
//! The split is by concern only: nothing on the published surface moved,
//! and every path that resolved through `crate::engine` before still
//! does.
