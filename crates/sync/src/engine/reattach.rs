/// The guard is armed at CONSTRUCTION, never inside an async body a poll late:
/// `open_replacement` builds it in the same synchronous step that receives the
/// replacement from the factory, and it travels with the replacement into
/// `reattach_account`, so there is no interval, a drop before that function's
/// first poll included, in which a live replacement is owned only by a local. It
/// tracks four debts:
///
/// - `live`, the push handles the replacement created. A handle is pushed here
///   in the same poll that `push_subscribe` returned it. The commit `disarm`s
///   them into the registry with no await between the two; an ordinary abort
///   empties them through `unwind_replacement_subscriptions`, which removes a
///   record only after its delete answered.
/// - `close_owed`, the account whose `close()` is still owed: the replacement
///   until the swap, and from `swapped` on the previous account. It is closed
///   through [`Self::close_owed`], which clears the debt only once the close has
///   RETURNED, so a drop parked inside a close owes it again.
/// - `rollback_owed`, the compensation for rows `reattach_insert` may have
///   written. Armed synchronously before the first insert, cleared once
///   `reattach_abort` answered.
/// - `commit_owed`, which `swapped` converts the rollback into. Past the swap an
///   abort would delete cursors belonging to a reattach that succeeded, so a drop
///   there must promote the rows instead. Cleared once the commit is enqueued.
///
/// On drop, the writer request is enqueued SYNCHRONOUSLY with `try_send`: it
/// lands in the writer's queue ahead of anything a later reattach could insert,
/// which a spawned task would not guarantee, and the abort only ever deletes rows
/// still provisional. A full channel falls back to a spawned send. Then a task is
/// spawned to delete the remaining `live` handles on the replacement (the only
/// account that can be trusted to know them), record every refusal as an orphan,
/// and close what is owed. With no runtime to spawn on, the handles are
/// registered as orphans directly, undeleted, and the close cannot run.
///
/// Orphans are retried against whatever account is current when they are
/// retried, not against the replacement that created them. That is an accepted
/// limit, benign in this workspace because no provider rejects a handle it does
/// not know (the retry clears the orphan and cannot fail forever), and it is the
/// reason the spawned task tries the replacement itself first. It is not a
/// guarantee of deletion: Graph, IMAP and JMAP keep a handle's server state in
/// the account instance, so a retry that reaches a newer connection is a no-op
/// and the provider-side subscription then lives until it expires. See
/// `reference/sync.md`.
