//! The scheduled retrier for push subscriptions whose teardown failed.
//!
//! A handle whose `push_unsubscribe` the provider refused is kept in the
//! registry as an orphan (`teardown_unconfirmed`, not `desired`) so the
//! server-side subscription stays reachable. Before this worker existed,
//! only the next reopen or the consumer's next `unsubscribe_push` retried
//! it, so an account that never reopened kept its orphan delivering until
//! the provider expired it (about a day for Graph). This worker retries on
//! a timer instead.

/// Retry every pure orphan's teardown each `interval` until the slot shuts
/// down.
///
/// Only pure orphans are retried. A record that is still `desired` is the
/// consumer's live coverage - even when its teardown is unconfirmed, which is
/// an aborted reopen's mark on a handle the old, still-installed account
/// serves - and deleting it here would end push the consumer still wants.
///
/// The pass deliberately does NOT take the slot's reopen lock, unlike
/// `unsubscribe_push` and reattach. It holds that lock's reason for
/// existing - a take / restore or a snapshot / replace interleaving with
/// another writer - nowhere: nothing is taken out of the registry, and the
/// only write is removing a record after its teardown succeeded. Every
/// interleaving therefore costs at most one redundant `push_unsubscribe`:
/// a reopen or consumer teardown that re-registers a handle this pass just
/// deleted hands it to the next pass, whose DELETE the provider answers as
/// already gone. Holding the lock across provider calls, on the other hand,
/// let one stalled attempt - the `Account` contract gives `push_unsubscribe`
/// no deadline - block every reattach, `subscribe_push` and
/// `unsubscribe_push` on the account, and a per-attempt bound tight enough to
/// prevent that would truncate a provider teardown that walks several ids
/// (Graph's) before it reached the later ones, every pass.
///
/// So the bound, `ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT`, is only a backstop against a future that
/// never resolves, generous enough for a multi-id teardown made of ordinary
/// requests. A timed-out attempt is a failure like any other. A pass cut
/// short by shutdown (detach cancels the token, then awaits and aborts its
/// workers) strands nothing: the record is still registered, for detach to
/// discard with the rest of the incarnation.
///
/// The interval is floored at `MIN_INTERVAL`, so a configured zero cannot
/// turn the worker into a hot loop.
