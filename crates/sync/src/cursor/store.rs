//! `CheckpointStore` trait and in-memory reference implementation.
//!
//! The engine's only persistence contract. Consumers wire their own backing
//! store; the engine never assumes sled / sqlite / rocksdb / anything specific.
//! The in-memory backend is for tests and for consumers happy to lose state on
//! process restart.
//!
//! Three kinds of stored object:
//! - `ChangeCursor` per `(account, scope)`.
//! - `BackfillCheckpoint` per `(account, scope, partition)`.
//! - One `DebtLedger` per account: what enumeration coverage was PROVED, what
//!   is still owed, and what an operator has decided about it.
//!
//! Backfill partitions are addressed by their opaque `Partition` bytes so
//! resume can pick up inside a partition rather than at the start.
//!
//! # The atomicity contract
//!
//! A checkpoint and the ledger state it implies are ONE logical write. They
//! cannot be two store calls, and no ordering of two independent writes is
//! crash-safe:
//!
//! - checkpoint first loses the debt: the cursor advances past objects nothing
//!   recorded, and the changes stream only reports what happens NEXT, so those
//!   objects are permanently invisible;
//! - ledger first records debt for progress that never committed.
//!
//! That is why [`CheckpointStore::apply_transition`] is the only mutating
//! operation. A backend may spread the state across several tables - the
//! representation is backend-owned, the atomicity is not.
