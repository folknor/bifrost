//! Coverage claims awaiting the acknowledgement that makes them durable.
//!
//! Coverage cannot travel with the checkpoint itself: `Checkpoint::Change`
//! carries a `ChangeCursor`, which is protocol-owned opaque bytes plus an
//! envelope tag, and it crosses the broadcast channel to a consumer and back
//! through `ack_checkpoint`. Widening it would push engine-internal concepts
//! through a published type every consumer matches on.
//!
//! So the producer records the claim here when it emits a checkpoint-bearing
//! batch, and the single durable writer reads it back when the matching
//! acknowledgement arrives. The record it then writes is still ONE atomic store
//! operation carrying both cursor and coverage - this map is in-memory engine
//! state on the path to that write, not a second durable lane.
//!
//! Losing it on a crash is consistent by construction: if the process dies
//! before the acknowledgement, the checkpoint never became durable either, so
//! no cursor advanced and there is nothing to remember.
//!
//! # Why publication identity, and not the checkpoint
//!
//! An earlier design keyed claims by `CursorScope`. That is unsound the moment
//! more than one thing per scope is in flight: two backfill partitions of one
//! scope each publish a checkpoint, the second overwrites the first's claim,
//! and acknowledging the FIRST then persists the second's coverage.
//!
//! Keying by `Checkpoint` is better and still not sufficient, because
//! `Checkpoint: Eq` is value equality, not a claim about publication identity:
//!
//! - `BackfillRunner` counts only entries a page MATERIALIZED, so a page whose
//!   content was entirely unrepresentable increments nothing; with no progress
//!   marker the next `BackfillCheckpoint` is byte-identical to its predecessor
//!   while describing a different boundary and a different coverage report.
//! - Inventory fusion publishes the same final checkpoint twice, once on the
//!   final batch and once on `Done`.
//! - A later walk can legitimately produce the same cursor bytes as an earlier
//!   one while proving different coverage.
//!
//! So the engine issues its own monotonic `PublicationId` per checkpoint-
//! bearing publication, and the acknowledgement names it.
