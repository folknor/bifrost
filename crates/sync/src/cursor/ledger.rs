//! The durable debt ledger: accumulated coverage lifecycle state.
//!
//! Distinct from `InventoryCoverageReport`, and the distinction is the point.
//! A report is one account's observation about one enumeration of one region.
//! The ledger is what the ENGINE has concluded after folding every accepted
//! report, every operator decision and (eventually) every repair result
//! together. Calling both "coverage" hid a seam where the interesting mistakes
//! live: an account reports evidence, the engine owns retry and
//! acceptable-loss policy, and no protocol crate may construct ledger state.
//!
//! Two axes, deliberately independent:
//!
//! - PROOF is what the system knows: `Unresolved` or `Discharged`.
//! - POLICY is what the system will do about it: `Retrying`, `OperatorBlocked`
//!   or `Waived`.
//!
//! Collapsing them is the mistake this module exists to prevent. A waiver is
//! accepted loss, NOT proof that the object was materialized or proved
//! irrelevant, so a waived obligation must never make a record claim complete
//! coverage - otherwise an operator (or a later full walk) cannot tell proved
//! coverage from loss somebody agreed to live with. Waiver may stop the
//! obligation blocking automatic backfill completion; it may not rewrite
//! history.
//!
//! The other rule with teeth: no local counter may produce `Waived` or
//! `Discharged`. A retry budget expiring is evidence that automatic work is not
//! helping, which is `OperatorBlocked` - the obligation stays visible and
//! manually retryable. Only an operator waives, because only an operator can
//! decide what loss is acceptable.
//!
//! The two axes also draw the compaction line: only `Discharged` entries fold
//! into [`DischargeAudit`], because only `Discharged` is terminal. Every
//! `Unresolved` entry stays a live entry, WAIVED ONES INCLUDED - a waiver is a
//! policy decision that never makes the proof terminal. See [`DischargeAudit`]
//! for the full argument.

///
/// # What the root can and cannot answer
///
/// The root is a DETECTION root. It answers "does this candidate history fold
/// to the same value the ledger recorded", which is what makes a restored,
/// replicated or externally-recorded discharge history checkable, and what
/// makes a discharge that quietly vanished - or a corrupted durable row -
/// detectable. It is emphatically NOT a proof of exact history: the root is a
/// commutative SUM of digests, and a sum of digests is not collision-resistant
/// the way a single digest is. Two different histories can in principle fold to
/// the same root, and nothing here defends against an adversary who can choose
/// obligation keys to make that happen. Accidental divergence and loss is the
/// threat model; forgery is not.
///
/// The audited history is also NARROWER than the word "history" suggests. Only
/// `(key, generation, evidence KIND)` enters the fold. A change to a repair
/// attempt id, a covering domain, a `ReplacedByChildren` child list or the text
/// of a `ProvedIrrelevant` reason is INVISIBLE to the root, at any hash
/// strength, because those payloads are diagnostic and legitimately vary
/// between revisions.
///
/// It deliberately cannot answer "was key K discharged" on its own, and that is
/// a decision rather than an oversight:
///
/// - The actionable state is open debt, and open debt is retained in full.
/// - An exact membership index means retaining the keys, which is the
///   unbounded growth this compaction exists to remove.
/// - A probabilistic index (a Bloom filter, say) errs by reporting DISCHARGED
///   for something that never was. That is precisely the silent-loss shape this
///   module exists to prevent, so a bounded-but-lying answer is worse than no
///   answer.
