//! Durable serialization for the whole [`DebtLedger`].
//!
//! `CheckpointStore::apply_transition` takes a checkpoint and the account's
//! entire ledger as one atomic write. The checkpoint half has had
//! [`encode_envelope`](super::envelope::encode_envelope) since the store trait
//! existed; the ledger half had nothing, so a persistent backend could store
//! only one of the two things the atomicity contract is about. A consumer
//! forced to keep ledgers in a process-lifetime map forgets accepted debt on
//! restart, and a degraded scope comes back looking clean until something
//! re-enumerates it - which is the exact silent-loss shape the ledger exists to
//! prevent, arriving through the persistence layer instead of through a walk.
//!
//! This module is the missing half. It is maintained TOGETHER with
//! `envelope.rs` and copies its conventions on purpose: same header shape, same
//! little-endian length-prefixed primitives, same `Error::SchemaIncompatible`
//! classification for a version outside the readable window, and the same rule
//! about where a panic is allowed (encode only, never decode).
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! ```text
//!   1 byte    magic = 0xB6      (0xB5 is the cursor envelope)
//!   3 bytes   reserved (zero)
//!   4 bytes   version (little-endian u32)
//!   4 bytes   entry count       -> N ledger entries
//!   4 bytes   barrier count     -> N barrier incidents
//!   4 bytes   proof count       -> N (generation, CoverageDomain) pairs
//! ```
//!
//! Version 2 appends one further section AFTER the proofs, in the payload
//! rather than in the header: a `u32` count followed by that many
//! `(CursorScope, DischargeAudit)` pairs, the compacted terminal history.
//! Appending in the payload rather than widening the header is deliberate - a
//! fourth header count would move `HEADER_LEN`, and then this decoder would
//! need two header shapes to read a version-1 row. A version-1 row simply has
//! no trailing section, so the same reader handles both by asking the version.
//!
//! A `BarrierIncident::resume_from` nests a whole cursor envelope through
//! `encode_envelope` / `decode_envelope` rather than re-deriving one: the
//! checkpoint codec owns that layout and its migration chain, and a second
//! decoder for the same bytes is a second thing to keep correct.
//!
//! # Why the error is a digest and not a reconstruction
//!
//! `LedgerEntry::last_error` and `BarrierIncident::evidence` are the one part
//! of the ledger that does not round-trip byte-for-byte, and the reason is
//! structural rather than expedient. `AccountError` carries a `Cause` chain
//! whose payloads include `&'static str` fields (`AccessCause::InsufficientScope
//! { needed }`, `RequestCause::InvalidArgument { field }`); a decoder holding
//! bytes cannot produce a `&'static str` without leaking, so an exact
//! reconstruction is not merely large, it is unrepresentable.
//!
//! So this codec persists the CLASSIFICATION exactly - `AccountErrorKind`,
//! `ErrorScope`, operation, provider, protocol and the full `DiagnosticInfo` -
//! and rebuilds the error through `AccountErrorBuilder` with the canonical
//! `Cause` its kind demands. The structured payloads of any secondary causes do
//! not survive as typed values.
//!
//! That loss is affordable because nothing decides anything on these fields.
//! Every ledger predicate - `blocks_completion`, `completion_permitted`,
//! `repairable`, `lineage_root`, `record_attempt`, discharge - reads proof,
//! policy, domain, generation and target, never the error; `LedgerEntry::target`
//! exists precisely so a repair descriptor is never taken from the error, whose
//! classifications and messages change between revisions. The error is operator
//! evidence, and operator evidence is what a digest preserves.
//!
//! What is NOT preserved, stated so a later reader does not assume otherwise:
//! secondary `Cause` payloads, `idempotency_override`, and `throttle_scope`.
//! The last two are overrides for deriving `RecoveryClass` on a live retry
//! decision, and a restored ledger error is never retried through - it is read
//! by an operator or an audit.
