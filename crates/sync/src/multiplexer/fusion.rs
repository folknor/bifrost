//! Inventory-fusion path.
//!
//! For `EstablishViaInventory` scopes (Graph all scopes,
//! IMAP-Basic / IMAP-CONDSTORE-only folders) the inventory walk IS the
//! cursor establishment. The multiplexer consumes the inventory stream
//! and registers the cursor exactly once, on the inventory's terminal
//! `Done` event. Mid-stream `Batch` checkpoints (if any) advance the
//! inventory progress marker only; the change cursor is established in
//! memory when the inventory's terminal `Done` arrives. Durable cursor
//! persistence still waits for the consumer ack of the terminal
//! checkpoint.
//!
//! Inventory data: every `Batch` is forwarded to the per-account
//! broadcast as an `ObjectChange::Created` signal before the cursor
//! is persisted, so cold-start inventory (Graph all scopes,
//! IMAP-Basic / CONDSTORE-only folders) does not vanish.
