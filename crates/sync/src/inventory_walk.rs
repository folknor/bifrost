//! Safety-critical state shared by both inventory walk front ends.
//!
//! Backfill and inventory fusion used to carry two independent copies of the
//! barrier rules, and their DIVERGENCE was the defect: one front end stopped
//! the walk at a barrier while the other kept accepting checkpoints past it.
//! Both now hold an `InventoryWalk` and route every barrier decision through
//! this module, so a rule can only be changed for both at once.
//!
//! What is shared here is the SAFETY-CRITICAL half only: the barrier decision
//! and the last accepted resume checkpoint. Checkpoint MINTING and terminal
//! `Done` handling remain two implementations, because the shapes genuinely
//! differ - fusion forwards the account's own checkpoint, backfill mints a
//! positional `page:F:T` from partition coordinates the account never sees.
//! That is an accepted structural residual, not an oversight, and no loss path
//! has been found through it across five rounds and two close passes; it is
//! tracked in `notes/todo.md` as sync-F3. The re-divergence risk is real but
//! bounded by the fact that a THIRD front end would have to appear for it to
//! bite, and a third front end is the trigger to revisit.
//!
//! Both front ends must refuse to announce a barrier the store REFUSED - the
//! backfill partition fails so the scope stays Pending and re-walks, the
//! fusion walk returns the error. A DEPARTED writer (detach or shutdown) is
//! deliberately non-fatal, because there is nothing left to persist to; a
//! store error is fatal, because there is. Getting this onto one front end and
//! not the other is exactly the divergence this module exists to prevent, and
//! it happened once already.
