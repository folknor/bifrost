//! Mutation pipeline.
//!
//! The engine wraps each `Account::bulk_*` call with:
//! - `IdempotencyKey` vending (run_id + monotonic sequence + protocol salt),
//! - per-id accumulation through `ItemOutcome<MutationSuccess>` lanes
//!   (applied / skipped / failed_terminal / pending_retry /
//!   pending_readback / blocked_by_engine),
//! - retry on `RecoveryPlan::Retry`, sleeping per `RetryAdvice` and
//!   re-submitting unresolved ids with the same key,
//! - the read-back guard, which re-fetches each pending-readback id via
//!   `account.get_stream(_, Projection::FlagsOnly)` and reconciles
//!   apparent failures against actual server state.
