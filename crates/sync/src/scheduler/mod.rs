//! Four-lane scheduler.
//!
//! The scheduler is a *gate*, not an executor. Tokio's runtime executes
//! futures; the scheduler decides which `Account` operation gets to
//! acquire concurrency tokens, in what order. Lanes are
//! `Foreground` > `Normal` > `Background` > `Bulk` with a starvation
//! floor: after N consecutive higher-lane pulls, the puller takes one
//! from a lower lane regardless.
//!
//! Concurrency caps are enforced by `budget::BudgetGate` (a layered
//! `tokio::sync::Semaphore` pair: per-account and global).
//!
//! Engine poll, push, backfill, and mutation work enters through
//! [`Scheduler::admit`]. Admission is NOT the `submit`/`pull` work-item
//! path: it has its own four scheduler-owned lanes and a single
//! dispatcher task that selects the next request only when the matching
//! [`BudgetGate`] permit can actually be granted. That ordering is the
//! whole point of the gate:
//!
//! - A blocked request waits in a bounded scheduler lane, never in the
//!   semaphore's FIFO. Requests that had already been dequeued and
//!   parked on the semaphore stopped counting against `lane_capacity`,
//!   which made the "bounded lanes" claim vacuous.
//! - Because nothing is parked on the semaphore, a `Foreground` request
//!   arriving after a `Background` one still runs first: the dispatcher
//!   re-plans when a strictly higher lane gains work, rather than
//!   inheriting the semaphore's arrival order.
//!
//! The dispatcher considers every distinct `(account, kind)` budget
//! class present in the lanes at once, not just the head. A single-head
//! dispatcher would block the whole engine behind one account whose
//! per-account sub-pool is exhausted, which is exactly the cross-account
//! starvation `BudgetGate`'s per-account layer exists to prevent.
