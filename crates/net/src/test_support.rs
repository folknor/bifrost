//! Supported in-process test seam for crates that ride `bifrost-net`.
//!
//! Account crates cannot construct a [`crate::Response`] directly - it
//! is `#[non_exhaustive]` by design, so the buffered response shape can
//! grow without breaking consumers. That left every net-riding crate
//! building its own private double, and each one had to re-derive
//! bifrost-net's status contract from scratch. The contract is easy to
//! get wrong in a way that hides live defects: the retry loop returns
//! `Err` for every 4xx/5xx, so a hand-rolled double that hands back a
//! 404 as `Ok(Response)` pins a branch production can never reach.
//!
//! This module removes the need to re-derive it. A canned response is
//! staged at the *wire* boundary, below retry, redirect, rate limiting,
//! and bandwidth metering, so a scripted test drives the real pipeline
//! and observes whatever the real pipeline would have produced.
//!
//! The dispatch trait itself stays crate-private: its signature is in
//! terms of `reqwest` types, and keeping `reqwest` out of the public
//! API is the reason this crate's request wrapper exists at all. What
//! is public is the scripted double and the `Net` constructor that
//! installs it.
//!
//! Gated behind the `test-support` feature. Consumers enable it as a
//! dev-dependency:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dev-dependencies]
//! bifrost-net = { path = "../net", features = ["test-support"] }
//! ```
