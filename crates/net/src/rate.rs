//! Per-host token-bucket rate limiter.
//!
//! Each protocol declares a `RateLimit` per host at client
//! construction. The governor enforces it on every request. `Notify`
//! is used rather than fixed sleeps so a 429 with a long
//! `Retry-After` can refund the unused cost and wake other waiters
//! immediately. Admission is FIFO: each `acquire` takes a ticket in
//! its host's queue and only the head may debit, so a waiter cannot
//! starve behind a stream of later arrivals.
