//! Sans-I/O protocol core for the SMTP and LMTP send paths.
//!
//! Every rule about WHAT the client says next, HOW MANY replies it must drain
//! before the stream is reusable again, WHICH `SmtpCommandPhase` decorates a
//! failure, WHEN a transaction is cleared with `RSET` versus abandoned with an
//! abort, and how each outcome lands in `SendProgress` lives here, once. The
//! blocking and async drivers are adapters: they move bytes, apply deadlines,
//! and perform the small vocabulary of [`Op`]s this module asks for.
//!
//! The shape is a step function rather than a straight-line routine because
//! the two adapters cannot share control flow - one blocks, one awaits. A
//! machine is asked for its next [`Op`], the adapter performs it, and the
//! result is fed back as an [`OpOutcome`]. Nothing here touches a socket, a
//! timeout, or a clock; a machine can be driven to completion in a unit test
//! with no I/O at all, which is what the `core_tests` module does.
//!
//! What deliberately stays adapter-side, because it is I/O rather than
//! protocol: connecting, the greeting and EHLO/LHLO exchange, the AUTH ladder,
//! the STARTTLS upgrade, reply-line reading and parsing, read/write deadlines,
//! throttling, and the socket shutdown that `Op::Abort` performs.
