///   RFC 6764's canonical shape is a well-known that redirects to another host,
///   and that host cannot be admitted to the credential-origin set before
///   discovery has authenticated anything - so the walk refuses it locally, and
///   that refusal is evidence about the probe, not about the account.
/// - A body that will not parse as DAV XML (`Protocol(ParseFailed)`). A front
///   end sitting on the origin root answers a PROPFIND with `200 text/html` and
///   its index page as often as it answers 404 or 405 - the same deployment
///   shape, one status apart - and an HTML document fails the XML parse rather
///   than decoding as an empty multistatus. Without this arm that deployment
///   fails the open while the identical one answering an empty 207 falls back
///   and works.
/// - A redirect the walk will not follow (`Protocol(ContractViolation)`): a
///   chain past the hop cap, or a `Location` that will not resolve or decode.
///   These classify as the transport's own redirect failures do, a provider
///   contract violation. That is honest about blame, and without this arm it
///   would silently narrow the predicate: as `Request(Malformed)` they used to
///   fall back through the refused-redirect arm above.
///   A well-known that loops is a probe answer nobody can use, the same shape as
///   one that will not parse, and the fallback's fresh lookup against the
///   configured base cannot inherit anything from it. On the probe path nothing
///   else mints this kind: redirects are disabled in the transport, so its own
///   redirect loop never runs, and the dispatcher maps an oversized body to
///   `Protocol(PartialResponse)` before the transport's mapping is reached.
///
/// Do NOT narrow the parse-failure arm. ANY `Protocol(ParseFailed)` from the
/// well-known principal lookup triggers the fallback, INCLUDING malformed or truncated DAV
/// XML from a genuine discovery endpoint. The predicate cannot distinguish that
/// from a non-DAV body: both arrive here as an XML parse failure with no headers
/// available, so the distinction is unobtainable at this seam rather than merely
/// unimplemented. It is safe because the fallback cannot accept bad data - it
/// performs a FRESH principal lookup against the configured base URL, requires
/// its result, and runs the subsequent discovery normally; nothing partially
/// parsed from the failed probe is reused, no origin from it is admitted, and
/// both the base leg and everything after the principal still propagate their
/// failures. The most a fallback can do is prefer the user-configured endpoint
/// over a probe that would not parse. The cost is a lost DIAGNOSTIC: an operator
/// does not learn that the well-known endpoint is serving truncated XML. That
/// cost is deliberately accepted here; it is not an open defect.
///
/// The arm stays safe precisely because it is probe-scoped: a garbage document
/// from the CONFIGURED base URL is a real contract violation and still fails,
