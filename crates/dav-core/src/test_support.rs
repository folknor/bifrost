//! Scripted DAV wire seam, shared by the CalDAV and CardDAV test suites.
//!
//! DAV rides `bifrost-net`, so the place to script a DAV flow is
//! `bifrost_net::test_support` - below retry, rate limiting, the byte meter and
//! the buffered ceiling, which is the layer no seam above `AccountNet` can
//! reach. This module is the DAV-shaped front for it: the two crates were
//! scripting `DavResponse` values through a local `DavTransport` double, and
//! that double sat ABOVE the transport, so nothing it pinned said anything
//! about what the real pipeline would do with the same bytes.
//!
//! Two contract facts inherited from the net seam, and they change how a DAV
//! test is written:
//!
//! - Every 4xx and 5xx becomes an `Err` inside the pipeline. The DAV dispatcher
//!   reconstitutes a terminal `Error::Status` back into a `DavResponse`, so a
//!   scripted 404 still reaches the DAV status ladder - but a scripted 503 is
//!   RETRIED first, and the script must answer every attempt.
//! - An exhausted script panics rather than reaching a socket, so a test that
//!   under-scripts fails loudly.
//!
//! Gated behind the `test-support` feature; the DAV crates enable it as a
//! dev-dependency.
