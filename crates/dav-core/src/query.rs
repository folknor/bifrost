//! The href-only filtered query lanes, shared by both protocol crates.
//!
//! A filtered listing lane (CalDAV `calendar-query`, CardDAV
//! `addressbook-query`) asks the server to decide membership and to answer with
//! `getetag` only. The account layer then sorts the candidate hrefs, slices the
//! page that follows the cursor watermark, and multigets ONLY that page - which
//! is what keeps a page bounded by the page size rather than by the size of the
//! collection.
//!
//! Everything here is protocol-neutral: the two crates differ only in the query
//! body and in which parser turns the 207 into hrefs.
