//! The one WebDAV 207 Multi-Status state machine.
//!
//! CalDAV and CardDAV parse the same document. `<response>` carries an
//! `<href>`, an optional response-level `<status>`, and zero or more
//! `<propstat>` blocks each pairing a `<prop>` bag with its own `<status>`.
//! Only the property NAMES and the entry types the caller builds differ, and
//! for a long time each crate hand-mirrored the whole machine. Eight defects
//! were recorded in those mirrored lines - every one of them a fix that landed
//! in one crate and not its twin - so the machine lives here once and each
//! crate supplies only a [`PropSet`] naming which properties it stages plus the
//! constructors that turn a finished response into its own entry type.
//!
//! Three rules are load-bearing and are enforced here rather than restated by
//! each caller:
//!
//! - **Stage under the status.** A property is read into the STAGED set while
//!   its `<propstat>` is open and promoted to the committed set only when that
//!   propstat's own status was 2xx. A server echoing the requested prop
//!   skeleton back inside a 404 - which real servers do - must not poison the
//!   committed etag, the `resourcetype`, or the privilege markers.
//! - **An absent status is success.** RFC 4918 s14.22 requires a status, but
//!   servers omit it and the properties beside it are genuinely there. A status
//!   that is PRESENT and unparseable is a failure, because it is not evidence
//!   that the property was returned.
//! - **Entry versus failed href.** A response whose ONLY propstat failed is not
//!   an entry; it is a transiently-failed resource whose href the caller
//!   preserves. A response carrying NO propstat at all is still a member the
//!   server named, and commits as an entry with whatever it supplied - dropping
//!   it out of both lanes makes the snapshot diff destroy a resource that
//!   exists.
