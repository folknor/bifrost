//! The DAV request record, response shape, and origin comparison.
//!
//! DAV traffic rides `bifrost-net` like every other HTTP protocol crate, so the
//! retry budget, per-host rate limiting, bandwidth metering and observability
//! are the shared ones rather than a second implementation. What DAV keeps for
//! itself is the credential-origin gate and the redirect walk that enforces it:
//! `AccountNet` strips `Authorization` on a cross-origin hop with no way to
//! restore it, and its trusted-host allowlist compares hosts where the DAV gate
//! compares scheme, host and effective port. Redirects are therefore disabled on
//! the account spec and walked here, one hop at a time, each with credentials
//! minted for the origin actually being addressed.
