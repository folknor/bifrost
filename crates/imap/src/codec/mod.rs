//! Audit boundary: the 2026-09-04 bug hunt read the strict-versus-tolerant
//! parse gate (which failures are connection-fatal) but did NOT line-audit
//! the decoder and encoder internals under `decode/` and `encode/`. An
//! absence of findings there is an absence of reading. Noted so a later
//! auditor knows where coverage stops.
