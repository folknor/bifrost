//! BODYSTRUCTURE part traversal and the durable IMAP part-handle encoding.
//!
//! Stage one of imap-G1. Nothing here is wired into inventory, hydration, or
//! the blob openers yet, and `AccountCapabilities::blob_range` deliberately
//! stays `BlobRangeSupport::No` until a projection actually mints these
//! handles: a capability that claims a byte path before handles exist is a
//! promise the crate cannot keep.
//!
//! Two pieces:
//!
//! 1. [`walk_bodystructure`] - turns a parsed [`BodyStructure`] into the flat
//!    list of individually fetchable parts, each carrying the facts a FETCH
//!    and a consumer-facing projection need: the IMAP part path, media
//!    type/subtype, transfer encoding (classified AND as the server spelled
//!    it), the server-reported octet size, and whatever identity the server
//!    gave (content-id, content-location, filename). It returns a
//!    [`PartWalk`], not a bare `Vec`, so a caller can never mistake a
//!    depth-limited walk for a complete enumeration.
//! 2. [`encode_part_handle`] / [`decode_part_handle`] - the versioned,
//!    length-prefixed handle string that survives a round trip through a
//!    consumer's storage.
//!
//! The decoded MIME part tree in `bifrost_types::mime` (`ParsedMessage` /
//! `MimePart`) is the *other* half of this story and is not duplicated here:
//! that tree is built from octets we already hold, whereas BODYSTRUCTURE is
//! the server's description of octets we have not fetched. This module reuses
//! `bifrost_types::mime` for every piece of decoding the two share - RFC 2231
//! parameter reassembly, RFC 2047 encoded words, and the `TransferEncoding`
//! vocabulary - so there is one definition of each, not two.
//!
//! # Part numbering rules implemented
//!
//! From RFC 3501 Section 6.4.5 / RFC 9051 Section 6.4.5. The numbering is
//! defined per *message context*, not per node, which is the distinction a
//! naive tree walk misses:
//!
//! - **Single-part message.** A message whose top-level body is not
//!   `multipart/*` has exactly one part, numbered `1`. `BODY[1]` is its
//!   content and `BODY[]` is the whole message. A walk that numbered the root
//!   node itself, or emitted no number at all, would be wrong here.
//! - **Multipart message.** The `multipart/*` container itself has no part
//!   number in its own right; its children are `1`, `2`, ... A nested
//!   `multipart/*` at path `2` numbers its children `2.1`, `2.2`, ... - so a
//!   container's path is a *prefix* of its children's, never a part number
//!   this module mints a handle for. Container nodes are therefore not
//!   emitted: there is nothing useful to hand a byte-range reader for one.
//! - **`message/rfc822` (and `message/global`) nesting.** A part at path `P`
//!   is itself fetchable (`BODY[P]` yields the encapsulated message including
//!   its headers), so it IS emitted, and then its inner body opens a fresh
//!   message context with prefix `P`: an inner `multipart/*` numbers its
//!   children `P.1`, `P.2`, and an inner *single* part is `P.1` - the
//!   single-part rule applied one level down, which is where the two rules
//!   compose and where implementations most often go wrong.
//!
//! # Shapes tested (`parts_tests.rs`)
//!
//! Real server-shaped structures, not invented ones: a plain `text/plain`
//! message, `multipart/alternative`, `multipart/mixed` with an attachment,
//! `multipart/mixed` wrapping a nested `multipart/alternative`, a nested
//! `message/rfc822` whose inner body is multipart, a nested `message/rfc822`
//! whose inner body is single-part, and `multipart/signed`. Every test pins
//! the exact part paths, because a wrong implementation produces a plausible
//! looking list with subtly wrong numbers. Two further cases pin the nesting
//! bound from both sides: the deepest structure the parser accepts walks
//! complete, and one level deeper is refused by the parser rather than
//! silently shortened by the walk.
