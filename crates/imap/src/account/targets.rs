//! Id-to-outcome accounting for one wire command.
//!
//! Every account-layer path that turns decoded object ids into a UID operand
//! and then attributes the server's answer back to those ids used to
//! re-derive "requested set -> wire operand -> outcome attribution" by hand.
//! Four copies of that derivation (flag mutation, destroy, move, hydration)
//! agreed only by convention, and the class of bug that convention admits is
//! real: an id silently dropped between the requested set and the operand
//! became either a fabricated `Succeeded(Applied)` or an id with no outcome
//! at all, both of which break the one-outcome-per-id contract the sync
//! engine holds.
//!
//! [`TargetBatch`] is the single owner of that derivation. It takes the
//! decoded ids, builds the wire [`UidSet`] from those ids and nothing else,
//! keeps an explicit lane for ids the operand could not represent, and is the
//! only way to mint the batch's outcomes.
//!
//! Exactly-once is a property of the types rather than of an assertion.
//! [`TargetBatch::settle`] drives the classification itself: it walks its own
//! targets and hands the caller one [`Target`] at a time - a non-`Clone`
//! permit carrying the id and the `BatchItemId` stamped from it - and the
//! caller must hand back the [`Sealed`] outcome that permit produced.
//! `Sealed` has no constructor but [`Target::seal`], which consumes the
//! permit, so a classifier cannot answer for an id twice (the permit is
//! gone), cannot skip one (it owes a `Sealed` per call and has no other way
//! to make one), and cannot stamp an outcome with an id the batch did not
//! give it (the batch stamps it, not the caller). No length check, no
//! id-keyed lookup, and nothing for a release build to skip.
//!
//! The one property Rust cannot express is that a `TargetBatch` must be
//! consumed at all: a value can always be dropped. That single residue is
//! still a debug assertion in [`Drop`], so a path that returns early with ids
//! unaccounted for cannot go unnoticed.
