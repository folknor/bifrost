//! Public IMAP polling surface: a typed view of IMAP message ids, folder
//! observation (UIDVALIDITY and UIDNEXT), generation-bound UID enumeration
//! and a raw read with typed outcomes.
//!
//! This is the one published surface beside the factory and its config
//! types. It exists for consumers that track arrivals per folder by UID
//! instead of running the sync engine's change streams: a message moved
//! into a folder with an old INTERNALDATE has a fresh UID, so a UID
//! watermark sees it where a date search does not.
//!
//! Identity: `(container, UIDVALIDITY, UID)` names a message only within
//! one account on one server. Persisted state must be keyed by the
//! consumer's account identity as well. A rename is a container identity
//! change; UIDVALIDITY alone cannot establish continuity across one.
