/// and nothing after. No behavioural test can detect a semantically identical
/// re-inlining; preventing future copies is a review property, not a runtime
/// one. What a test CAN do is pin the rule itself, so that a centralized
/// implementation which is wrong is caught however many wrappers delegate to
/// it. That is this table.

/// The rule used to be written out five times, over four different views, and
/// only two of the copies had any test. The three without were the ones that
