//! Atomic admission shared by the caller and the driver.
//!
//! Every wire command carries one admission cell, shared by the caller's
//! [`Pending`] and the driver's [`Reply`]. The cell moves through four states:
//!
//! - QUEUED: submitted, not yet at the head of the driver's queue.
//! - CLAIMED: the driver won [`Reply::claim`] and holds the payload, but has
//!   neither offered a byte of the command to the stream nor answered it.
//!   This is where the driver prepares the command and waits for its first
//!   bandwidth grant.
//! - COMMITTED: the driver won [`CommitGate::commit`], the step it takes
//!   immediately before offering the command's first byte, and before
//!   publishing any answer ([`ClaimedReply::answer`] commits first).
//! - WITHDRAWN: the caller won [`Pending::withdraw`] from QUEUED or CLAIMED.
//!
//! Withdrawal and commitment are one compare-exchange race, so exactly one
//! side wins. A won withdrawal is provably never written and never answered:
//! its evidence is a true `Unsent`, and the connection stays reusable. A
//! committed command is the driver's exchange: a caller that leaves it with no
//! answer in hand reports `InFlight` and abandons the connection.
//!
//! The commit point sits BEFORE the first offer to the stream rather than at
//! the first socket progress on purpose. Once a byte is offered, a TLS or
//! COMPRESS layer may hold it while the socket counter (`stream::Tracked`)
//! has not moved, and nothing could later take it back out of that layer;
//! before the offer, no layer holds anything of the command, and the command
//! before it finished with a successful flush. So no rule about bytes
//! buffered above the socket is needed: withdrawal is simply impossible once
//! any could exist.
//!
//! COMMITTED is "the driver has irrevocably bound itself to writing or
//! answering", not "it has written or answered": between a won commit and the
//! oneshot send there is a window where a leaving caller conservatively reads
//! `InFlight` for a command that is only being refused. That window is
//! accepted; it is never unsafe.
