/// This wait has two modes, and which one applies is decided entirely by

///
/// With `routing: None` - single-command dispatch - exactly one
/// command is on the wire, `own_tag`, and any untagged response has no
/// consumer to route to and becomes an event. A tagged response ends the
/// wait:
///
/// * its own `NO`/`BAD` is the refusal of the command, an ordinary error that
///   leaves the connection usable (the server ended the command, and the
///   unsent remainder is never written);
/// * its own `OK` means the server completed the command without granting
///   the literal it was owed a `+` for. The exchange is over and the framing
///   intact, so this is the non-fatal `ProtocolMissing`, and the remainder is
///   likewise never written (it would be read as a new command line);
/// * any other tag cannot belong to anything, since nothing else is
///   outstanding: a desynchronization, `Protocol`, connection-fatal.
///
/// In pipeline mode `own_tag` is the command being written; the router
/// carries the same fact in `sending` and decides by its own rules.
///
/// With `routing: Some(..)` the caller is `run_pipeline_batch`, which sends
/// command by command whenever any command of the batch has a synchronizing
/// literal (a segment boundary in its encoded form). Commands already on
/// the wire then have tags still pending, and their responses arrive HERE. So
/// this wait routes them through the pipeline's own router rather than
/// answering them itself:
///
/// * a tagged response for an earlier command is that command's completion,
///   routed into its result slot;
/// * an untagged response solicited by an earlier command reaches the
///   consumer that asked for it;
/// * the tagged `NO`/`BAD` of the command being written is its own ordinary
///   per-command result, and the wait answers `Rejected` so the sender
///   abandons the rest of that command rather than failing the batch;
/// * a tagged `OK` for the command being written is that command's result too,
///   as the same non-fatal `ProtocolMissing` the single-command mode raises
///   (see [`early_ok_error`]), and the wait answers `Rejected`. Nothing of any
///   later command has been written - the send phase is sequential whenever a
///   literal is synchronizing - so the server cannot read a later command's
///   bytes as the missing literal, and the next command goes out as a fresh
///   command line exactly as after a `NO`.
///
/// Both halves matter. Answering a foreign tagged response here destroyed an
/// earlier command's real result and reported its `NO` as a failure of the
/// command being written; answering a foreign untagged response as an
/// anonymous event was worse, because the batch then COMPLETED and the caller
/// got a silently short result with no error at all.
