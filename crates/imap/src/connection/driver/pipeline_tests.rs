//! Byte-level transcripts for the pipeline send phase.
//!
//! These all exercise one window: a pipelined batch in `Synchronizing`
//! literal mode, where the commands go out one at a time and the batch is
//! blocked mid-send waiting for a `+` continuation. Responses belonging to
//! EARLIER commands arrive in that window, and before the read-time router
//! landed the send phase had no way to reach their consumers.
//!
//! Getting a batch into that window is fiddly and the constraints are worth
//! stating, because a transcript that misses any of them exercises nothing:
//!
//! * the greeting must advertise neither `LITERAL+` nor `LITERAL-` nor
//!   `IMAP4rev2`, or the literals are non-synchronizing and the whole batch
//!   goes out in one write with no wait to interrupt;
//! * the two commands must have DISTINCT `CommandKind`s, or
//!   `group_into_sub_batches` splits them into sequential sub-batches and
//!   there is never more than one tag outstanding;
//! * the SECOND command must carry a synchronizing literal. Most pipelinable
//!   commands cannot produce one: mailbox names go through mUTF-7 and come
//!   out ASCII-quotable. `LISTRIGHTS` can, because its identifier is passed
//!   through raw, so a non-ASCII identifier forces a literal.
