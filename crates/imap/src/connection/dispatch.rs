//! Consumer trait and dispatcher for the new routing architecture.
//!
//! Consumers do NOT route. `classify` routes. Consumers only receive
//! responses that `classify` has already determined are theirs (either
//! solicited or `Either`) and they interpret them.
//!
//! The `Consumer` trait is typed (associated type `Output`).
//! `ConsumerErased` is a blanket-impl wrapper for the pipeline path,
//! which needs `Box<dyn ...>`.
