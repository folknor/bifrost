//! Container, label, and provenance types for the unified PIM

//!
//! A `Container` is a folder, label, or mailbox the account exposes
//! as a place a message can live. The unified shape lets the consumer
//! branch on `kind` (Folder | Label) when it wants a folder-binary
//! UI, on `role` when it wants ratatoskr's canonical INBOX / SENT /
//! DRAFT / ARCHIVE / TRASH / SPAM rendering, or on `provenance` when
//! it needs the wire-level native id to round-trip back to the
//! protocol.
