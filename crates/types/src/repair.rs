//! Provider-native repair of inventory coverage debt.
//!
//! An `InventoryObligation` records something an enumeration could not account
//! for. Repair is the pass that tries to account for it later, and it is
//! deliberately NOT `get_stream`: that hydrates known ids at a projection and
//! cannot express region replay, completeness proof, or authoritative absence.
//! Only the protocol crate knows what a provider-native re-read needs.
//!
//! # What crosses which boundary
//!
//! A successful inventory walk does NOT deliver `InventoryEntry` values to a
//! consumer. The engine takes each entry, keeps the id, discards the rest, and
//! publishes `ObjectChange::Created`; the consumer hydrates from there. Repair
//! mirrors that exactly:
//!
//! ```text
//! account  ->  ObjectRecovered { entry }
//! engine   ->  validate, keep the id, retain the evidence, discard the entry
//! consumer ->  ObjectChange::Created(id)
//! ```
//!
//! The entry still crosses the ACCOUNT boundary, because constructing it is the
//! proof that the representation failure which raised the obligation has
//! actually healed - an id alone would only prove the object still exists. It
//! does not cross the CONSUMER boundary, because no inventory path does.
//!
//! That is what makes repair free of the version race it looks like it should
//! have. A repair signal carries no object state, so it cannot overwrite a
//! newer representation or resurrect a deleted object: a stale `Created` is
//! resolved by hydration returning not-found, exactly as it already is for a
//! backfill page that races a live deletion. Repair needs no conditional
//! application, no tombstones, no version-relation hook, and no exclusive lease
//! against the live change stream.
//!
//! # The discharge bar
//!
//! An obligation says: the walk failed to tell the consumer this object exists,
//! and the cursor then advanced past it, so the changes stream will never
//! mention it again. A durably acknowledged `Created` signal IS that telling,
//! and it is the most any successful walk ever achieves for any object.
//! Requiring repair to prove successful hydration would hold it to a standard
//! the non-degraded path does not meet and fuse two failure domains: inventory
//! coverage asks whether enumeration announced the object, hydration asks
//! whether a projection can currently be fetched. A later hydration failure
//! belongs to the hydration lane and its `ItemOutcome`.
