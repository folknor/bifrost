//! The `Account` trait and the `AccountFactory` companion trait.
//!
//! The trait is dyn-safe by construction: all stream and future
//! returns are erased through `AccountStream<T>` / `AccountFuture<T>`,
//! the cursor state is a concrete tagged blob rather than an
//! associated type, and `close` takes `&self` so it composes with
//! `Arc<dyn Account>`. A compile-time `_dyn_safe` check in
//! `lib.rs` verifies this at every build.
//!
//! Two-tier surface:
//!
//! - Primitives (no default impl): wire-level operations every
//!   protocol crate implements. The Account-impl-side surface.
//! - Conveniences (default impl in terms of primitives): ratatoskr-
//!   shaped composites. Protocol crates override only when the
//!   default is wrong for that provider; consumers who disagree with
//!   ratatoskr's defaults use the primitives directly.
