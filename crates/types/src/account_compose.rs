//! Reusable account-composition helpers.
//!
//! A composing account (today IMAP; tomorrow JMAP / Graph) can attach
//! CardDAV / CalDAV sub-accounts and present their typed scopes as
//! first-class sync scopes. The two pieces every composing account needs
//! are the same:
//!
//! - [`route_typed_scope`] - decide whether a `CursorScope` is serviced
//!   by the composing account itself or delegated to a contacts /
//!   calendars sub-account, keyed only on the scope and `ObjectType`.
//! - [`merge_scope_streams`] - fan the composing account's own discovery
//!   items in with each sub-account's discovery stream into one bounded
//!   stream (warnings, then one final batch, then one `Done`).
//!
//! These are protocol-agnostic: they name only `CursorScope`,
//! `ObjectType`, `Account`, and the stream/event types. The composing
//! crate maps [`ScopeTarget::This`] onto its own per-protocol handler
//! (e.g. IMAP resolves it to a `MailboxName`) and builds the
//! `Unsupported` error in its own error vocabulary.

/// Merge the composing account's own discovery `items` with each

///
/// A sub-account discovery error is folded into a `Warning` rather than
/// terminating the merged stream: the engine re-runs discovery on every
/// reopen, so a transient sub failure self-heals.
///
/// Two deliberate properties of this fan-in, called out because they are
/// not obvious from the signature:
///
/// - **Sub-account checkpoints are dropped.** Each sub's discovery stream
///   may carry its own `Batch.checkpoint` / `Done(Some(..))` cursor, but
///   the merged batch emits `checkpoint: None` and `Done(None)`.
///   Discovery is a stateless re-enumeration the engine reruns on every
///   reopen, so there is no merged cursor to persist; a sub's per-stream
///   checkpoint has no meaning once its items are folded into the
///   composing account's single discovery batch.
/// - **Subs are drained sequentially, fully buffered.** There is no
///   per-sub timeout and the first byte is delayed until every sub has
///   reached `Done`/`Terminated`. A sub that never terminates blocks the
///   whole merged stream. This is a constraint of `bifrost-types` having
///   no async runtime / timer of its own (see the module-tail note); a
///   timeout would have to be imposed by the composing crate around the
///   per-sub `discover` closure it supplies, not here.

// These protocol-agnostic helpers are exercised by their first consumer,

// double: `route_typed_scope` via the IMAP router tests and
// `merge_scope_streams` via the IMAP discovery fan-in tests (both the
// merge and the fold-sub-failure-into-warning paths). `bifrost-types`
// itself has no tokio dependency and no `Account` implementation; a unit
// test here would have to vendor a full ~60-method `Account` double plus
// a hand-rolled busy-loop executor into the foundational crate purely to
// re-prove what the consumer already pins, so the test lives with the
// consumer.
