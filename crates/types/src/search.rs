//! Search request AST.

//! Canonical intersection of JMAP `Email/query` `FilterCondition`,
//! IMAP `UID SEARCH`, Gmail query strings, and Graph OData
//! `$filter`. Operators outside this set are reached via the
//! protocol-specific `provider_query` escape on the request.
//!
//! Each protocol Account impl translates the AST into the
//! provider's native shape; `provider_query`, when set, is
//! concatenated as the protocol expects (Gmail and Graph append a
//! raw query string; JMAP submits it as a `text` filter; IMAP
//! ignores it unless the consumer wired a Sieve-flavored
//! interpretation in their adapter).
