# bifrost error model reference

The shared `AccountError` contract every protocol crate produces and
every consumer (`bifrost-sync`, downstream apps) reads. Lives in
`crates/types/src/error/` and is re-exported from
`bifrost_types::error`. Per-provider wire-to-`AccountError` mapping is
documented in each `reference/<crate>.md`; this doc is the shared
target they map onto. The code is authoritative for anything derivable
(the kind/cause/recovery enums and the `derive` table); this file
captures the load-bearing shape and the invariants the table enforces.

## AccountError

`AccountError` (`account_error.rs`) is an opaque
`Arc<AccountErrorInner>` newtype: `Clone` is one Arc bump, so it rides
through batch lanes, broadcast channels, and `Fatal` wrappers without
deep copies. `#[non_exhaustive]`, no public fields, no public
constructor - the only way in is `AccountErrorBuilder`. The inner
struct carries `kind`, derived `recovery` / `remediation` /
`message_key`, optional `scope` / `operation` / `provider` /
`protocol`, the `DiagnosticInfo`, and the `CauseChain`.

Accessors (all `&self`, cheap): `kind`, `recovery`,
`suggested_remediation`, `scope`, `operation`, `provider`, `protocol`,
`message_key`, `chain`, plus the diagnostic projections below.
`Display` prints `"{message_key} ({kind:?})"` - never free-form
provider text. `StdError::source()` bridges to `chain.outermost()` so
`?`-chaining and `anyhow`-style walkers reach the primary cause. Rust's
`StdError` source interface is linear and cannot represent the remaining
sibling evidence; the full ordered chain is available through `chain()` and
the internal support export. Each `Cause` variant is itself `StdError`.

`into_builder(self)` is the **decoration** path, not reclassification.
It unwraps the Arc (clone-on-share), splits the chain into primary +
extras, and returns a builder pre-loaded with the original `kind`,
primary `Cause`, top-level fields, and diagnostics. The builder exposes
no kind-changing method; `push_cause` only appends secondary evidence.
Derived fields recompute on `try_build`. Builder overrides
(`idempotency_override`, `throttle_scope`) are preserved across the
round-trip, as is a `ServerCause` retry hint because it lives in the
chain. Reclassifying to a
different primary kind/cause requires a fresh `AccountErrorBuilder::new`.

## AccountErrorBuilder funnel

`builder.rs`. `AccountErrorBuilder::new(kind, primary_cause)` is the
sole entry; setters are `#[must_use]` consuming-`self` (`operation`,
`scope`, `provider`, `protocol`, `push_cause`, `request_id`,
`trace_id`, `status`, `native_code`, `text`, `idempotency_override`,
`throttle_scope`).

The terminator is **`try_build` -> `Result<AccountError,
AccountErrorBuildError>`**, not an infallible `build`. The `Err` arm is
a producer-bug surface, not recoverable runtime state: protocol-crate
translation boundaries call
`.expect("valid account error classification")`. `AccountErrorBuildError`
(`#[non_exhaustive]`) enumerates the five enforced invariants:

- `EmptyChain` - every error carries at least one primary `Cause`.
  `CauseChain::try_new` enforces this at the chain boundary. The current
  public `new` requires a primary, so this remains a defensive invariant
  for future construction paths.
- `KindCauseMismatch { kind, primary_cause }` - the declared `kind`
  and the outermost `Cause` disagree (`recovery::kind_matches_cause`).
- `ThrottleScopeNotApplicable { kind, throttle_scope }` - a
  `throttle_scope` attached to anything but
  `Server(RateLimited | QuotaExhausted)`. Its own variant because the
  kind and cause may match each other perfectly; the diagnosis must
  point the producer at the throttle scope, not a mismatch that is
  not there.
- `TransportAcknowledged` - `Transport(_)` kind paired with any
  `Attempt(Acknowledged)` cause. Transport failure means no complete
  server response arrived; an acknowledged attempt belongs on a
  `Server`/`Protocol` kind.
- `CursorInvalidWithoutScope` - `SyncState(CursorInvalid)` without an
  `ErrorScope::Cursor`. The engine cannot route a scope-less cursor
  restart; the convergence rewrite removed the silent
  `RestartAccount` fallback, so producers must thread the scope.

On success `try_build` derives `recovery` (`recovery::derive`),
`remediation` (`recovery::suggest`), and `message_key`
(`message_key::derive`) from the validated parts, then freezes the
Arc. Derivation is pure: same parts in, same classification out.

## AccountErrorKind and message keys

`kind.rs`. `AccountErrorKind` (`#[non_exhaustive]`) is the stable
top-level taxonomy with per-family subkind enums:

- `Transport(TransportErrorKind)` - `Network` / `Timeout` / `Tls`.
- `Authentication(AuthErrorKind)` - `Expired` / `RefreshTransient` /
  `Revoked` / `ReauthorizationRequired`.
- `Authorization(AccessErrorKind)` - admin consent, conditional
  access, policy, scope, permission, account-disabled, mailbox
  unavailable (`MailboxUnavailableKind::{Transient,Permanent}`),
  not-licensed.
- `Server(ServerErrorKind)` - `Unavailable` / `RateLimited` /
  `QuotaExhausted` / `Error { status: Option<u16> }`.
- `SyncState(SyncStateErrorKind)` - cursor invalid, strategy failure,
  scope-capability lost, schema incompatible, capability changed,
  operator-override needed, scope revoked.
- `ConcurrencyConflict` (flat).
- `Request(RequestErrorKind)` - `Malformed` / `BatchInputInvalid`.
- `NotFound(ResourceKind)` - message, mailbox, thread, calendar,
  contact, draft, identity, vacation, push-subscription, account,
  filter (a server-side mail rule: ManageSieve script, Gmail filter,
  JMAP SieveScript - the operation enum already treats filters as first
  class, so a missing one does not borrow an unrelated resource).
- `Unsupported(AccountOperation)`.
- `Protocol(ProtocolErrorKind)` - parse-failed, missing-field,
  contract-violation, partial-response, unknown.

`message_key::derive(&kind) -> &'static str` is the stable telemetry
namespace: dotted, family-prefixed, hyphenated leaf
(`transport.network`, `auth.refresh-transient`,
`authz.admin-consent-required`, `server.rate-limited`,
`syncstate.cursor-invalid`, `concurrency.conflict`,
`request.batch-input-invalid`, `notfound.message`,
`protocol.partial-response`, `unsupported.operation`, ...). The keys are
exhaustively pinned by
`documented_message_keys_are_derived`. Two collapse subkind detail:
`Server(Error { status })` is always `server.error` (status rides in
`DiagnosticInfo`, not the key), and `Unsupported(_)` is
`unsupported.operation`. The dotted convention is the contract; read
`message_key.rs` for the live list rather than copying it here.

## RecoveryClass

`recovery.rs`. `RecoveryClass` (`#[non_exhaustive]`) is the consumer's
dispatch surface. Four mutually-exclusive, exhaustive helpers partition
it (proven by `recovery_helpers_are_mutually_exclusive_and_exhaustive`):

- `is_retryable()` -> `Retry(RetryAdvice)`.
- `requires_reconciliation()` -> `Reconcile(ReconcileAdvice)`.
- `requires_engine_action()` -> `Engine(EngineDirective)`.
- `is_terminal()` - an explicit match over the terminal variants (`AuthLost`,
  `NeedsAdminConsent`, `NeedsPolicyChange`, `NoPermission`,
  `Unsupported`, `ClientBug`, `ProviderContractViolation`,
  `ProviderRefused`, `UnknownPermanent`).

`EngineDirective`: `RestartScope(CursorScope)`, `RestartAccount`,
`DowngradeStrategy(StrategyDowngrade)`,
`DowngradeCapabilityForScope(CursorScope)`, `SchemaIncompatible`,
`OperatorOverrideRequired { reason }`, `DisableScope(CursorScope)`
(quarantine one cursor scope without escalating account-wide: a revoked
shared/other-user IMAP folder). There is no longer a
`CapabilityChanged` directive - capability shifts route to
`RestartAccount` so the engine re-runs discovery (the
`StateCause::CapabilityChanged` delta is forensic-only).

`RetryAdvice { disposition, retry_hint, reason, throttle_scope }`.
Retry timing is a single **`RetryHint` enum**, not split fields:
`After(Duration)` (delta-seconds / `min_delay` semantics) or
`At(SystemTime)` (HTTP-date `Retry-After`). `not_before(now)` and
`min_delay(now)` resolve it either way (the split `not_before` +
`min_delay` fields the spec once carried produced the side-channel bug
the convergence rewrite eliminated). `disposition` is
`RetryDisposition::{SameRequest, AfterStateRefresh, AfterAuthRefresh}`;
`reason` is `RetryReason::{Transport, ServerUnavailable, RateLimited,
QuotaExhausted, ConcurrencyConflict, RefreshTransient}`.

`ReconcileAdvice { reason, guidance, retry_hint, throttle_scope }`:
`ReconcileReason::{TransportDropAfterSend, PartialCompletionSignal,
ThrottledMidFlight}`
plus `guidance.actions: Vec<ReconcileAction>` where `ReconcileAction`
is `CheckTarget` / `DedupeByClientId`.
Both advice structs are explicitly `#[non_exhaustive]`.
`ReconcileGuidance` is an ordinary constructible public struct, so the nested
shape is not accidentally sealed.

`ThrottleScope::{CurrentOperation, Mailbox, Account, Tenant, Provider}`
is the producer hint; the engine lifts the sharable scopes into a
`ThrottleKey::{Mailbox, Account, Tenant, Provider}` bucket.
`CurrentOperation` is a per-call inline delay and never enters a key.

`Fatal(AccountError)` is the terminal-only newtype. `TryFrom` accepts
iff `recovery().is_terminal()`, returning the error back on the `Err`
arm otherwise. `Fatal` is the type-system collapse point that enforces
"the engine has nothing left to try": every terminal `RecoveryClass`
variant funnels into one carrier. The engine does not ship a built-in
operator-notification queue or permanent-failure dashboard - both
terminal arms emit a structured `TelemetryView` `warn!`; any operator
queue is the consumer's to build off the broadcast
`SyncEvent::Terminated`.

`RemediationAction` (operator-facing suggestion, derived by `suggest`):
`RefreshToken`, `Reauthorize`, `RequestAdminConsent { needed }`,
`UpdateTenantPolicy`, `CheckMailboxLicense`,
`RetryLater { retry_hint }`, `FixClientRequest`,
`ContactProviderSupport`.

### Central derivation

`recovery::derive(kind, scope, operation, chain, throttle_scope,
idempotency_override)` is the single mapping. Two inputs come from
outside the kind: `tx_state` = the first `Attempt` cause's
`TransmissionState` (default `Unsent`), and `idempotent` =
`idempotency_override` else `operation.is_idempotent()` (a `None`
operation is treated idempotent). The rules at altitude (read
`derive_*` for exact rows):

- **Transport** -> always transient. `transient_retry_or_reconcile`:
  `Unsent`/`Acknowledged`, or `InFlight`+idempotent -> `Retry(SameRequest,
  Transport)`; `InFlight`+non-idempotent ->
  `Reconcile(TransportDropAfterSend, [CheckTarget])`. `Acknowledged` is
  a producer bug here: `debug_assert!` in debug, defensive demotion to
  `InFlight` in release (and `try_build` rejects it upstream anyway).
- **Authentication** -> `RefreshTransient` is `Retry(AfterAuthRefresh,
  RefreshTransient)` (carries the chain's server retry hint); `Expired` /
  `Revoked` / `ReauthorizationRequired` collapse to `AuthLost`.
- **Authorization** -> `AdminConsentRequired` ->
  `NeedsAdminConsent { needed }`; conditional-access / policy / scope /
  not-licensed -> `NeedsPolicyChange`; `PermissionDenied` ->
  `NoPermission { resource }`; `AccountDisabled` and
  `MailboxUnavailable(Permanent)` -> `ProviderRefused`;
  `MailboxUnavailable(Transient)` -> `Retry(SameRequest)`.
- **Server** -> `Unavailable`/`RateLimited`/`QuotaExhausted` route
  through `transient_retry_or_reconcile` (rate/quota propagate
  `throttle_scope` and the retry hint). A rate/quota response on an
  in-flight non-idempotent operation reconciles as `ThrottledMidFlight`
  while retaining both fields, so engine buckets and the reconciliation
  delay still honor the provider signal. `Error { status }`: 5xx (or no
  numeric status while `InFlight`) is transient; everything else (4xx,
  IMAP `NO`/`BAD` not in-flight) -> `ProviderRefused`.
- **SyncState** -> all `Engine(_)`: `CursorInvalid` -> `RestartScope`
  (scope guaranteed by build-time check); `StrategyFailure` ->
  `DowngradeStrategy`; `ScopeCapabilityLost` ->
  `DowngradeCapabilityForScope` (or `RestartAccount` if no scope);
  `SchemaIncompatible` -> `SchemaIncompatible`; `CapabilityChanged` ->
  `RestartAccount`; `OperatorOverrideNeeded` ->
  `OperatorOverrideRequired { reason }`; `ScopeRevoked` ->
  `DisableScope` (or `RestartAccount` if no scope).
- **ConcurrencyConflict** -> `Retry(AfterStateRefresh,
  ConcurrencyConflict)`.
- **Request** (both subkinds) -> `ClientBug`.
- **NotFound** -> `ProviderRefused` (unconditional; the per-operation
  "this NotFound is benign, absorb it" policy is **not** in this module
  - it lives at the call site in each protocol crate's operation, which
  swallows the absent-resource case before building an error).
- **Unsupported** -> `Unsupported(op)`.
- **Protocol** -> parse / missing-field / contract-violation ->
  `ProviderContractViolation`; `PartialResponse` -> `Retry(SameRequest)`
  if idempotent else `Reconcile(PartialCompletionSignal, [CheckTarget,
  DedupeByClientId])`; `Unknown` -> `UnknownPermanent`.

## Cause chain

`cause.rs`. `CauseChain` is a non-empty ordered `Vec<Cause>`:
`outermost()` (the primary, index 0) and `root()` (last). `Cause`
(`#[non_exhaustive]`) variants:

- `Transport(TransportCause { kind, message })`,
- `Attempt(AttemptCause { transmission_state })`,
- `Auth(AuthCause)`, `Access(AccessCause)`, `Server(ServerCause)`,
  `State(StateCause)`, `Request(RequestCause)`,
- `Wire(WireCause)`.

`AttemptCause` / `TransmissionState::{Unsent, InFlight, Acknowledged}`
is the **transmission-evidence** carrier: it is what `derive` reads to
choose retry-vs-reconcile, and what `try_build` cross-checks against
`Transport`. Producers thread it as a secondary cause via `push_cause`.

`ServerCause` carries the optional `RetryHint` for the
unavailable/rate/quota arms (the only structural channel for retry
timing). `StateCause` carries engine-directive payloads
(`StrategyDowngrade`, `CapabilityChanged { delta }`,
`OperatorOverrideNeeded { reason }`).

`WireCause` is **diagnostic-only** - it never feeds `derive` (the
recovery mapping keys off `kind`, not the raw wire code). It preserves
the provider's native vocabulary for support exports:
`Graph(GraphSignal)`, `Jmap(JmapMethod)`, `Imap(ImapResponseCode)`,
`Smtp(EnhancedStatusCode)`, `Gmail(GmailSignal)`, and
`MalformedResponse { protocol, detail }`. Each provider enum exposes
`code()` (the on-wire string) for telemetry. `Cause::summary()` projects any
cause into a flat `CauseSummary` for the internal export tier. Alongside kind,
detail, transmission state, status, and native code, the projection preserves
structured transport kind, access resource and needed scope, strategy
downgrade, capability delta, invalid batch items, unsupported operation, and
invalid argument field evidence.

## Batch and stream outcomes

`batch.rs`. `BatchOutcome<T>` (`#[non_exhaustive]`, immutable) is the
**three-lane** result of a `Vec<BatchItem<_>>` operation:
`succeeded: [BatchSuccess<T>]`, `failed: [BatchFailure]`,
`uncertain: [BatchUncertain]`, plus an `order` index so `iter()`
replays submission order. The lanes are closed by design - a fourth
lane is a deliberate breaking change, never a wildcard-absorbed
extension. `BatchFailure` and `BatchUncertain` each carry an
`AccountError`; the uncertain lane is the batch analogue of an
`InFlight` non-idempotent drop and always queues for read-back.

`BatchItemId(String)` correlates each lane entry back to its submitted
`BatchItem`. `BatchOutcomeBuilder` accumulates via `push_succeeded` /
`push_failed` / `push_uncertain`, then `finalize(&expected)` enforces
the **accounting invariant**: every submitted id appears in exactly one
lane, with no missing / duplicate / unknown ids, else
`BatchInvariantError { missing, duplicates, unknown }`. This is a
producer-bug surface caught by per-crate tests.

Boundary contract for batch-shaped `Account` methods: **`Err(_)` means
nothing was transmitted** (whole-request failure); **`Ok(BatchOutcome)`
means every item is accounted for exactly once** across the three
lanes. `validate_batch_input` is the pre-flight guard - empty input or
empty/duplicate `BatchItemId`s surface as
`Request(BatchInputInvalid)` before any byte crosses the side-effect
boundary. The guard returns the classified `AccountError` directly. Empty
input uses `RequestCause::BatchInputEmpty`, with no fabricated item id;
item-specific failures use `BatchInputInvalid { items }`.

`validate_batch_input(items, protocol, operation)` takes the operation as a
required parameter, not as something the caller decorates afterwards.
Centralizing the construction is exactly what made dropping it possible -
the first centralization did drop it, and SMTP's rejections stopped
reporting `AccountOperation::Send`, leaving telemetry and support exports
unable to say which operation refused the input and the derived idempotency
wrong on top of that.

`Protocol::Unknown` exists for errors the ENGINE mints about an account's
behaviour rather than errors a protocol crate maps from a wire response.
There is no protocol accessor on `dyn Account`, so where the offending
payload carries no protocol tag of its own (a backfill checkpoint, say) the
error declines to name one rather than guessing. Protocol crates always know
their own protocol and must never use it.

The same three lanes carry `push_subscribe`, whose input is a scope list
rather than a `Vec<BatchItem<_>>`. `PushSubscription { handle, outcomes }`
puts a `BatchOutcome<CursorScope>` beside an optional handle: the handle
covers exactly the succeeded lane, refused scopes carry their own
scope-correlated `AccountError` in the failed lane, and the handle is absent
when no scope was accepted. `BatchItemId`s are the scopes' submission
positions, because a `CursorScope` is not an id and one request may legitimately
name the same folder twice. No fourth lane and no parallel contract: an
`Err(_)` from `push_subscribe` still means no scope was subscribed at all.

`stream.rs`. `ItemOutcome<T>` is the streaming counterpart -
`Succeeded(BatchSuccess<T>)` / `Failed(BatchFailure)` /
`Uncertain(BatchUncertain)` - the same closed three-lane model, emitted
per item instead of collected. Deliberately not `#[non_exhaustive]`: a
wildcard arm would let stale consumer policy silently apply to a new
lane. `MutationSuccess::{Applied, Skipped, Downgraded { actual }}` is the
mutation success payload, and the three are distinct answers to
distinct questions: `Applied` means the target is in the requested
state, `Skipped` means it already was and nothing was done, and
`Downgraded` means the provider accepted a WEAKER operation - the target
changed but is not in the requested state, and `actual: MutationEffect` says
what weaker operation landed.

`Downgraded` exists because reporting either neighbour in its place is
a wrong answer a consumer cannot detect. Gmail `bulk_destroy` under the
`gmail.modify` OAuth scope cannot permanently delete, so it falls back
to moving the messages to Trash: reported `Applied`, the engine believed
a state it re-observed as false on every subsequent pass and re-issued
the destroy forever; reported `Skipped`, a real mutation would be
hidden. `bifrost-sync` files it `PendingReadback` rather than trusting
it, so the final accounting comes from observed state - a downgrade is
the one success report whose own claim is known to be incomplete.
Gmail reports `MovedToContainer(TRASH)`. A provider that applied only the
representable subset of a flag operation reports
`FlagsPartiallyApplied { unsupported }`, preserving the flags it could not
apply for read-back and diagnostics. It is deliberately NOT queued for
resubmission: a downgrade is not
transient, and replaying it earns the same downgrade.

"The target changed" is a precondition of `Downgraded`, not a description
of it. An operation the provider could not perform at all - every
requested flag unrepresentable, so no request is even sent - is not a
downgrade and must not borrow the lane. It produces `ItemOutcome::Failed`
per id with `Unsupported(operation)` -> `RecoveryClass::Unsupported`,
which is permanent and not retried. This matters beyond tidiness:
`bifrost-sync` files every `Downgraded` as `PendingReadback`, so a no-op
wearing the downgrade lane schedules a read-back for a mutation that
never happened, and spends the read-back budget of a real one. Protocol
crates: if there is nothing you could do, say so in the failure lane.

## Diagnostics and consent tiers

`diagnostic.rs`. `DiagnosticInfo` holds `request_id`, `trace_id`,
`status`, `native_code`, and `text: Vec<DiagnosticText>`.
`DiagnosticText { value, visibility }` tags each string
`DetailVisibility::{UserSafe, SupportOnly}` (constructors
`user_safe` / `support_only`). This tagging drives a graduated
consent-tier export off `AccountError`:

- `telemetry_fields()` / `support_minimal()` -> `TelemetryView`:
  discriminants + ids + structured recovery fields + transmission state.
  Producer-supplied ids and native codes pass through the bounded, single-line
  `TelemetryToken`; rejected values remain support-only text and are omitted
  from telemetry. **No free-form text** (`telemetry_has_no_free_form_text`); safe
  to ship to metrics unconditionally.
- `user_safe_text()` -> iterator over only the `UserSafe` strings.
- `support_consented()` -> `SupportExportConsented`: telemetry +
  user-safe text + support-only text + `scope`. Requires user consent.
- `support_internal()` -> `SupportExportInternal`: the consented export
  plus the full `chain` as `CauseSummary`s. Internal tier only.

All export structs are `Serialize`; `TelemetryView` projects the
recovery fields (disposition/reason/throttle for retry,
reason/actions/throttle for reconcile, none for terminal) via the
`recovery_fields` / `recovery_discriminant` matches in
`account_error.rs`.

## Scope, operation, provider, protocol

`scope.rs`. `ErrorScope` (`#[non_exhaustive]`, custom `Serialize`)
locates the failure: `Account`, `Cursor(CursorScope)`, and id-bearing
`Mailbox` / `Message` / `Thread` / `Calendar` / `Contact` plus the
collection variants. The id-bearing variants use the same typed ids as
the account surface (`MailboxId`, `ObjectId`, `ThreadId`, `CalendarId`,
`ContactId`) and serialize their inner strings for support exports.
`scope_fields` is the single source for both the declared struct field
count and the fields written, so the count cannot drift from the body
across the variable-width cursor shapes - a drift that self-describing
JSON hides but length-prefixed formats turn into corrupt output.
`AccountOperation` is the large
`#[non_exhaustive]` operation enum; `is_idempotent()` is the
**authoritative idempotency source** `derive` consults. Absolute-state writes
against a known id, including the `*Update` family and the singleton settings
writers, are idempotent; sends, creates, deletes, moves, renames, uploads, and
other potentially double-applied side effects are not. Rename is with the moves
deliberately: IMAP `RENAME` keys on the old name rather than an id, so a replay
of a rename that landed names a mailbox that no longer exists. `Provider` and
`Protocol` are the small stable provenance enums.

## Warning is outside the error model

`warning.rs`. `Warning { kind: WarningKind, message, next_action,
protocol_detail, retry_count }` is **deliberately not** part of the
error model: it is advisory, never aborts a stream, carries no
`RecoveryClass`, and never converts to `AccountError`.
`WarningKind::{StrategyDowngraded, OperatorAttentionNeeded, Throttled,
ClockSkew, BlobNotByteStream, ReadbackSkipped, Other}`. The sync engine
emits warnings alongside (not instead of) errors; see `reference/sync.md`.
