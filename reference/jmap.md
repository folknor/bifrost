# bifrost-jmap reference

Current architecture of the JMAP implementation crate. The only external surface is `bifrost_jmap::sync` (account factory + config types). The protocol client, typed wire objects, transport, method macros, error type, and helper facade are crate-internal.

## Public surface

With the `sync` feature enabled, consumers may use:

- `sync::JmapAccountFactory` - registered as `Arc<dyn AccountFactory>`.
- `sync::JmapAccountFactoryBuilder` - open-time factory builder.
- `sync::JmapCredentials` - Basic or bearer credentials. `bearer(token)`
  / `bearer_source(Arc<dyn TokenSource>)`; the source threads through
  `account_token_source()` into bifrost-net, read live per request.
  `Clone`, hand-written `Debug`, no `PartialEq`/`Eq`.
- `sync::ReconnectPolicy` - WebSocket reconnect backoff config.

Everything else in `crates/jmap/src/` is `pub(crate)` or narrower. Consumers reach JMAP by constructing the factory, opening an `Arc<dyn Account>`, and calling `bifrost-types::Account` methods.

## Internal method dispatch

Every JMAP method is a self-describing struct implementing `JmapMethod`:

```rust
pub(crate) trait JmapMethod: Serialize + Send {
    const NAME: &'static str;       // "Email/get"
    type Cap: Capability;           // capability::Mail
    type Response: DeserializeOwned; // GetResponse<Email<Get>>
}
```

Adding a new method: define a struct, use `define_get_method!` / `define_set_method!` etc. Zero central files touched.

The method-generation macros are crate-private. They are re-exported
inside the crate root only so sibling modules can keep the existing
`crate::define_*` call sites without exporting macro names to consumers.

## Internal request/response flow

```rust
let mut request = client.build();
let handle = request.call(EmailGet::new(&account_id))?;  // typed CallHandle<EmailGet>
let mut response = request.send().await?;
let result = response.get(&handle)?;  // compile-time safe extraction
```

`CallHandle<M>` validates call_id and method name. `Response::get()` returns `Error::Method` for JMAP method-level errors.

## Internal transport abstraction

`Client<T: HttpTransport = ReqwestTransport>` is generic over transport.

- `HttpTransport` - api_request, upload, download, get_session (returns `Bytes`).
- `SseTransport` - open_sse (EventSource, with `last_event_id` support).
- `ReqwestTransport` - default implementation with a pooled reqwest::Client.
- `Client::with_transport(transport, session)` - crate-internal custom transport injection.
- WebSocket remains reqwest-specific (documented).

All convenience helpers are `impl<Tr: HttpTransport> Client<Tr>` so custom transports get the full API.

## Module pattern

Every JMAP object type under `crates/jmap/src/<type>/`:

- `mod.rs` - struct with `<State = Get>` phantom, Property enum, method struct definitions via `define_*_method!` macros.
- `get.rs` - getters on `T<Get>`, GetObject impl.
- `set.rs` - builder methods on `T<Set>`, SetObject + SetObjectCreatable impls.
- `query.rs` - Filter/Comparator enums, QueryObject impl.
- `helpers.rs` - `impl<Tr: HttpTransport> Client<Tr>` convenience methods.

## Two data models

**Typed structs** (Mailbox, Calendar, AddressBook, etc.): serde derive, `Field<T>` for nullable properties.

**JSON map backing** (CalendarEvent, ContactCard): `serde_json::Map` via `json_object_struct!` macro. Property enum has `Other(String)`. Extension properties preserved on round-trip.

## Key types

- `Field<T>` - three-state nullable: `Omitted` / `Null` / `Value(T)`. Use instead of `Option<Option<T>>`.
- `Id<T>` - phantom-typed string ID: `AccountId`, `BlobId`, `State`. Available for incremental adoption.
- `Account<Tr>` - internal account-scoped view of `Client`. Use `account.build()` for scoped requests inside the crate.
- `Capability` trait - typed URIs with associated `Config` type.
- `TransportError` - crate-owned, `#[non_exhaustive]`, carries response body (`Bytes`) for ProblemDetails parsing.

## Capabilities

`Capabilities` enum in `session.rs` uses `deserialize_capabilities_map` to dispatch on URI key string. When adding a new capability:

1. Add struct in `session.rs`.
2. Add variant to `Capabilities` enum (with `#[cfg]` if feature-gated).
3. Add match arm in deserializer.
4. Add `Capability` impl in `capability.rs` with `type Config`.
5. Add session accessor method.

`Session::typed_capability::<C>()` is a convenience bridge (serde round-trip). Hand-written accessors are zero-cost and primary.

## Feature gates

Per-RFC features: `mail`, `calendars`, `contacts`, `blob`, `quota`. Each gates:

- Internal module declarations in `lib.rs`.
- DataType enum variants (with `#[serde(other)]` catch-all).
- Capabilities enum variants + session accessors + deserializer arms.
- PushObject/PushNotification variants.
- Test modules.

The Account layer under `crates/jmap/src/sync/` wires optional PIM capabilities at open. `contacts.rs` maps AddressBook/ContactCard methods onto the shared contact primitives (incl. JSContact postal addresses); `calendar_ops.rs` maps Calendar/CalendarEvent onto list/range/get/create/update/delete/RSVP/search. Create payloads stamp the mandatory top-level `@type` (`Card` / `Event`) and the `@type` on the nested RFC-defined objects (Name, EmailAddress, Phone, Organization, Address, Note; Participant, Location, RecurrenceRule, NDay). JSContact photo media is written with `kind: "photo"` (resource role, not a URI marker) so self-written photos read back; the read path filters on that kind.
Range queries send a server-side `AND(inCalendar, after, before)` filter and reapply the local overlap predicate after hydration. Recurrence maps common RRULE fields to JSCalendar `recurrenceRules` and back; simple RDATE/EXDATE map through `recurrenceOverrides`. Unsupported outbound RRULE parts are rejected before Set construction; modified overrides and less common recurrence features stay outside the mapping. JSCalendar `until` is a LocalDateTime, so a UTC RFC 5545 `UNTIL=...Z` (needs the event timeZone to normalize) is rejected; floating and date-only UNTIL pass through.
Event time updates: JSCalendar derives end from `start` + `duration`, so a patch must carry both `start` and `end` (recomputing `duration`); a one-bound patch is rejected Unsupported rather than dropping the change or keeping a stale duration. All-day ends follow the exclusive `EventTime` contract: inbound end is `start + duration` days and outbound `duration` is `end - start` days (a single all-day event is start D / end D+1 / `P1D`), uniform with caldav/google/graph.
JSCalendar `alerts` project onto the read-only `CalendarEvent.reminders` surface (OffsetTrigger -> relative offset with `relativeTo`; AbsoluteTrigger -> absolute `when`; alert `action` carried through). Privacy maps JSCalendar `privacy` <-> visibility (`secret` -> `Confidential`); status maps `EventStatus` <-> `status`. Organizers map to/from JSCalendar owner participants (created events write the organizer as `owner`). `freeBusyStatus` standardizes `free`/`busy`, so shared Tentative/OutOfOffice serialize as busy.
RSVP resolves authenticated email aliases from Basic credentials and RFC 9670 Principal/get when available, then patches the matching participant's `participationStatus` by dotted path; without a known email it falls back to the single non-owner attendee, and ambiguous events return unsupported. If the server lacks the relevant capability, flags are false and calls return JMAP-stamped `Unsupported`.

## Error model

The crate-internal JMAP error type uses structured variants. No
`Error::Internal(String)`:

- `CallNotFound`, `IdNotFound`, `EmptyResponse`, `NotParsable`, `InvalidUrl`, `WebSocketClosed`, `WebSocketNotConnected`.
- `Transport(TransportError)` - wraps transport errors, auto-parses ProblemDetails from body.
- `Method(MethodError)` - JMAP method-level errors.
- No `From<reqwest::Error>` - reqwest errors converted to TransportError at point of use.

## PatchObject null semantics

RFC 8620: `null` removes map keys, not `false`. Email `patch` field uses `HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>` with `Value::Null` for removals.

## JMAP-specific code style

- `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "...")]` on optional fields.
- `Field::is_omitted` for `skip_serializing_if` on `Field<T>` fields (with `#[serde(default)]`).
- `SetObjectCreatable::new()` initializes optional fields to `None`/`Omitted`, not empty collections.
- Helper impl blocks use `impl<Tr: HttpTransport> Client<Tr>` (not bare `impl Client`).

## Account layer

The `bifrost_types::Account` impl under `crates/jmap/src/sync/` (gated on `sync`) is engine-facing only: the sync tree depends on `bifrost-types`, not `bifrost-sync`. It wraps the JMAP client (`Client<ReqwestTransport>` + a `Mail`-capability `Account` handle) and maps each `Account` trait method onto one or more JMAP calls.

Cursors are protocol-tagged opaque bytes (hand-rolled length-prefixed format), scope-aware in establishment and change streams. Push uses the JMAP WebSocket subprotocol with a single reader task and broadcast fan-out.

### `JmapAccount` / `JmapAccountFactory` shape and lifecycle

`JmapAccountFactory` carries a `JmapAccountFactoryBuilder` config (URL, `JmapCredentials::Basic`/`Bearer`, optional timeout, `accept_invalid_certs`, `ReconnectPolicy`). `AccountFactory::open(account_id)` connects a `Client`, passing the engine account id into the `bifrost-net` attachment so metering / priority / caps / trace use the real key on reopen. Open resolves the primary `Mail` account plus optional `Submission`/`VacationResponse`/`Quota`/`Sieve`, reads the session, builds `AccountCapabilities` + `CoreLimits`, probes initial `Email`/`Mailbox`/`Thread` state to seed cursors (and the same per foreign account), spawns the WebSocket reader with a `CancellationToken`, and returns `Arc<dyn Account>`.

`JmapAccount` (`pub(crate)`) owns the `Client`, the primary `Mail` `Account` handle, a `foreign_mail: Arc<HashMap<String, MailAccount>>` of shared/delegate-account handles keyed by JMAP `accountId`, optional `Submission`/`VacationResponse`/`Quota`/`Sieve` handles, the built capabilities, per-scope cursor seed states, the `WsState`, a subscription registry, and per-`accountId` state caches (`email_states`/`mailbox_states`/`thread_states`, each `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, Option<String>>>>` via `state_cache.rs`). The maps are keyed by accountId because JMAP state is per-`(accountId, type)`; the primary account's id is one ordinary key. `set_priority`/`set_bandwidth_cap` delegate to `bifrost-net::AccountNet`. See "Foreign (shared/delegate) accounts" below.

Reopen is engine-delegated: on drop or `close()`, the engine calls `JmapAccountFactory::open` again. `close()` cancels the shutdown token (terminating the WebSocket reader and in-flight streams) then awaits teardown; the `closed` flag short-circuits later calls. Cancellation safety relies on the shared `CancellationToken` plus `tokio::select!`; no `Account` method holds non-cancel-safe state across an await.

### Capabilities advertised

`capabilities::build` reads `session.core_capabilities()` and `session.websocket_capabilities()` to construct `AccountCapabilities`:

- `cursor_freshness: ServerIssued`; `blob_range: No`; `blob_digest_pre_download: false`.
- `push: InProcess` when the session advertises `urn:ietf:params:jmap:websocket` with `supportsPush: true`, else `None`.
- `mutation.concurrency: StateBased` (every `Email/set` gated by `ifInState`); `mutation.replay_safety: None`.
- `batching_policy`: `max_items = core.maxObjectsInSet` clamped `[1,500]`, `max_wait: 100ms`, `flush_on_input_close: true`.
- `rate_limit_class: Generous`; `quota_signal: None` (quota via `quota_get`); `requires_uidvalidity_recheck: false`; `historyid_/delta_token_expires_after: None`.
- `pim_methods` advertises mailbox membership add/remove, keyword/read-state mutation, `set_importance`, attachment upload, draft lifecycle, search, mailbox CRUD, identity list/update (Submission), vacation get/set (VacationResponse), quota get (Quota), and thread/message hydration. `scheduled_send` is true iff `Submission` advertises `maxDelayedSend > 0` (onto `PimSupport.max_delayed_send` for boundary validation). Gmail labels, Graph categories/extended properties are false.
- `filter_rule_shape: Scripts` and every filter flag true with a primary Sieve account; without Sieve they are false and the shape is `None`.
- `conveniences`: `starred = Keyword`, `replied`/`forwarded`/`mdn_sent` via keyword true, extended-property routes false. `set_starred`/`mark_replied`/`mark_forwarded`/`mark_mdn_sent` map to `$flagged`/`$answered`/`$forwarded`/`$MDNSent`. `set_importance` is two-valued: `High` sets `$important`, else clears; read maps `$important` presence onto `Message.importance`.

`CoreLimits` holds `maxObjectsInGet` and `maxObjectsInSet` - the only two limits the JMAP `Account` impl actually reads. `build` rejects a session whose advertised core limits (including `maxCallsInRequest` and `maxSizeRequest`) are zero, even though those latter two are validated and discarded.

### Cursor envelope

`OpaqueChangeState` for JMAP is tagged with `ProtocolKind::Jmap` and `envelope_version = ENVELOPE_VERSION_V1` (currently `1`). `CHANGE_CURSOR_ENVELOPE_VERSION` is the matching `ChangeCursor.envelope_version`.

The payload is hand-rolled, length-prefixed bytes (little-endian `u32` lengths, single-byte tags):

```
state-tag:u8        // STATE_TAG_V1 = 1
scope-tag:u8        // 1=Email 2=Mailbox 3=Thread 4=Query 5=Folder
[query-id:length-prefixed-utf8 when Query]
[account-id + mailbox-id:length-prefixed-utf8 (each) when Folder]
state-string:length-prefixed-utf8
```

`JmapCursorState::V1 { scope: JmapScopeRepr, state_string }` is the only current variant. `JmapScopeRepr` mirrors the supported scope shapes: `Email`, `Mailbox`, `Thread`, `Query(String)`, and `Folder { account_id, mailbox_id }` (the foreign-account mailbox; round-trips through the `foreign.rs` codec). `SCOPE_TAG_FOLDER = 5` is additive under the same `ENVELOPE_VERSION_V1` - existing primary cursors (tags 1-4) still decode, no version bump.

Validation rules in `state::decode`:

- Wrong `ProtocolKind` returns `Error::CursorProtocolMismatch`.
- Unknown `envelope_version` returns `Error::CursorEnvelopeUnknown`.
- Any decode failure (unknown state tag, unknown scope tag, truncated payload, trailing bytes, non-UTF-8 string) returns `Error::SchemaIncompatible`.
- `decode_cursor` additionally rejects a payload whose embedded scope does not match the `ChangeCursor.scope`, returning `Error::Other`.

`establish_initial_cursor(scope)` returns `CursorEstablishment::Ready` with a cursor built from the seed state captured at `open()` (including per-mailbox foreign `Folder` seeds). Unseeded scopes return `Error::Unsupported`. `describe_cursor` reports `Cheap`/`ServerCursor` for valid cursors, `Expensive`/`None` otherwise.

### Per-scope inventory, changes, hydration

Supported scopes for `inventory_stream` and `changes_stream`:

- `CursorScope::Type(ObjectType::Email)` - inventory paginates `Email/query` (`receivedAt` desc) then `Email/get` with a fixed property set (Id, MailboxIds, ThreadId, BlobId, Size, Keywords, MessageId, References, InReplyTo, ReceivedAt). Changes use `Email/changes` emitting Created/Updated/Destroyed `ObjectChange`s. `inventory_partitioning` exposes `Page { from, to }` for Email only. The page-windowed stream (`email_inventory_page`) pages `Email/query` internally to fill its `[from, to)` window, advancing position by the count the server actually returned and stopping only on an empty query page - a server whose query page cap is below the window width must not be read as end-of-inventory (it would truncate the backfill), so a short page is never the terminal signal.
- `CursorScope::Type(ObjectType::Mailbox)` - inventory is a single `Mailbox/get` (Id, Name, ParentId, Role, SortOrder, totals, unread counts, IsSubscribed). Changes use `Mailbox/changes`.
- `CursorScope::Type(ObjectType::Thread)` - changes use `Thread/changes`; inventory fatals (thread inventory derives from email inventory).
- `CursorScope::Query(_)` - changes use `Email/queryChanges` and surface `ScopeChange` events; inventory fatals (registered query definitions are out of scope for the v1 trait).
- `CursorScope::Folder(FolderId(encode_foreign(account_id, mailbox_id)))` - a foreign (shared/delegate) account mailbox. Inventory paginates `Email/query` filtered `inMailbox` on the parsed native mailbox id against the foreign account handle; changes use that account's `Email/changes`. See "Foreign (shared/delegate) accounts".

Every change-stream batch carries a `Checkpoint::Change(ChangeCursor)` whose state string is the post-call `newState`. The loop continues until `hasMoreChanges` is false, then emits `SyncEvent::Done`. The per-`accountId` `state_cache` maps advance compare-and-swap style (keyed by the scope's accountId) so a stale writer does not clobber a newer state.

`get_stream` (hydration) supports `Projection::FlagsOnly` and `Metadata` for Email; raw-MIME projections fatal-unsupported (whole-message raw is `open_raw_rfc822`: one `Email/get` for `blobId` then `client.download`). Batches size at `max_objects_in_get`. Hydrated emails emit `ItemOutcome::Succeeded`; locally-invalid ids or transport-drop ambiguity flow through `Failed` / `Uncertain` rather than terminating the stream.

### Push and reconnect

Push runs through one reader task spawned at `open()` when the session advertises WebSocket push. It connects via `Client::connect_ws`, validates `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: jmap`, re-applies the subscribed `DataType` union, emits `Reconnected`, and forwards `PushObject::StateChange` as `Invalidated` (`PushSource::JmapStateChange` + `HintPayload::SpecificCursorScope`). Stream errors emit `Disconnected` and fall to the reconnect loop.

`ReconnectPolicy { initial: 1s, max: 60s }` controls exponential backoff (reset on success). Every reader exit error is classified through `into_account_error(_, PushStream)`: terminal classes emit `Terminated(AccountError)` and stop the reader for engine reopen; retry classes emit `Disconnected` and continue backoff.

`push_stream` is a thin broadcast subscriber. A `Lagged` slot emits a coalesced `Invalidated { source: Coalesced, payload: Unknown }` so the engine full-repolls rather than losing notifications.

`subscribe` and `unsubscribe` build the union of all live `SubscriptionHandle` -> `DataTypeSet` mappings and call `Client::enable_push_ws` / `disable_push_ws`. `WebSocketNotConnected` maps to `Error::Unsupported` to signal the engine that push is unavailable.

`scope_lifecycle_stream` polls `Mailbox/changes` against the primary mailbox state, emitting `ScopeLifecycle::Created`/`Renamed`/`Deleted`. Poll errors classify through `into_account_error`; terminal/engine classes break the loop for reopen. Ending the stream is the protocol signal (no typed `Terminated`). Foreign-account mailbox lifecycle is not polled (see Foreign accounts).

### Mutation pipeline

`bulk_set_flags`, `bulk_move`, and `bulk_destroy` share a `mutation_stream` engine. Targets batch at `max_objects_in_set` clamped to `[1, 500]`; each batch is one `Email/set` gated by `ifInState(current_state)`. On `stateMismatch` the pipeline probes current state via `Email/get` (empty ids), updates the cache, and retries the batch once. Other errors abort with `SyncEvent::Terminated(AccountError)`.

`IdempotencyKey` is a wire no-op, so replay safety stays `None` (read-back guard protects against double-apply). Per-id outcomes flow from `SetResponse::updated`/`destroyed`; a `stateMismatch` surviving retry emits `Failed(ConcurrencyConflict)`, other errors map through `into_account_error`. `bulk_move` accepts only `MembershipScope::Mailbox`.

### PIM primitives and conveniences

`pim.rs` is the Stage 1 unified mail surface. Message/thread mutation resolves `MutationTarget::Thread` via `Thread/get`, then `Email/set` patches against `mailboxIds`/`keywords`/`$seen`, guarded by the cached `Email` state with one `stateMismatch` retry. Gmail labels, Graph categories/extended properties return `Unsupported`.

`attachment_upload` stores bytes through the upload URL, returns an opaque blob handle. `draft_create`/`update`/`discard` use `Email/set` against Drafts. `send_message` creates the draft `Email` + `EmailSubmission` in one result-referenced request, then `onSuccessUpdateEmail` to Sent (or `onSuccessDestroyEmail` when `save_to_sent == Some(false)`). `draft_send` submits an existing draft and moves it to Sent, resolving Sent and Drafts from a single `Mailbox/get` via `role_mailboxes`. A `SendRequest::send_as` routes both sets to a successfully seeded foreign account that advertises Submission, resolves a concrete foreign `Identity/get` identity, and forces its `identityId`; `As` forces From to that identity and `OnBehalfOf` adds the authenticated user's Sender when known. Scheduled foreign sends are rejected because their bare submission handles cannot be safely routed through cancel/reschedule.

The `onSuccessUpdateEmail` payload (`EmailPatch::submitted_to_sent`) is built entirely from dotted-path patches, matching RFC 8621 s7.5's own submission example: `mailboxIds/{draftsId}: null`, `mailboxIds/{sentId}: true`, `keywords/$draft: null`. Assigning `mailboxIds` as a whole value would be a *replacement* and would silently drop any unrelated membership the submitted message also holds (a label-as-mailbox filing, a shared folder). When the caller cannot resolve a Drafts mailbox the drafts path is omitted: the message gains Sent and keeps whatever it had, which is the recoverable degradation.

Scheduled send rides RFC 8621/4865 FUTURERELEASE: when `SendRequest::scheduled` is `Some(t)`, the boundary validates `t` against `max_delayed_send`, forces an envelope, and stamps `holduntil` (RFC 3339) as a `mailFrom` parameter. A scheduled `send_message` returns the **EmailSubmission id** (undo-addressable). `cancel_scheduled_send` sets `undoStatus: canceled`; `reschedule_send` cancel-and-resubmits (no in-place reschedule) with a new `holduntil`.

Search maps the shared `SearchRequest` AST to `Email/query` (query text as a JMAP `text` filter). `search_messages` returns native email ids; `search` uses `collapseThreads = true`, hydrates the emails' `threadId`, returns thread ids. Page cursors are opaque position bytes.

Container CRUD is `Mailbox/get`/`set`. Mailboxes surface as `ContainerKind::Folder` (native mailbox id); `Mailbox.role` maps to `FolderRole` (`inbox`->INBOX, `sent`->SENT, `drafts`->DRAFT, `trash`->TRASH, `junk`->SPAM). `container_delete` leaves `onDestroyRemoveEmails = false`, so non-empty deletion fails rather than dropping messages.

Settings use `Identity/get`/`set`, `VacationResponse/get`/`set` (`singleton` id), and `Quota/get`. `identity_update` supports name/signatures/reply-to; default-identity selection is unsupported.

`thread_hydrate` does `Thread/get` then `Email/get` in order. `message_hydrate` selects headers / preview / full projections and returns blob handles without pre-downloading. `move_thread`/`delete_thread` add-to-target then remove-from-source; deleting from Trash destroys the emails.

### Server-side filter scripts

`filters.rs` maps Stage 2 filter primitives onto JMAP Sieve:

- `filters_list` runs `SieveScript/query`, hydrates with `SieveScript/get`, downloads each blob, returns `ServerFilter::Script`.
- `filter_create` uploads the body as `application/sieve`, creates a `SieveScript`, and `onSuccessActivateScript` when asked active.
- `filter_update` patches name/body via `SieveScript/set` (body uploads a fresh blob first); `is_active` toggles via `onSuccessActivate/DeactivateScript`.
- `filter_delete` destroys the id; `filter_validate` uploads then `SieveScript/validate`, mapping set errors to `FilterValidation` diagnostics.

Typed `ServerFilterCreate::Rule` / `ServerFilterPatch::Rule` return `Unsupported`.

### HTTP redirect handling

`ReqwestTransport` delegates redirects to `bifrost-net` (JMAP trusted-host allowlist, five-hop limit). `bifrost-net` strips `Authorization` on every cross-host hop, including injected Basic headers. The bearer path routes through bifrost-net; only Basic and the WebSocket handshake build a header via async `header_value()`.

### Error translation

`sync/error.rs::into_account_error(error, ctx)` is the single translation boundary: it consumes `crate::Error` plus a `JmapErrorContext { operation, scope, .. }` and emits an `AccountError` via `AccountErrorBuilder`, routing `(AccountErrorKind, Cause)` plus operation, scope, and any `AttemptCause` through `bifrost-types::recovery::derive` (central `RecoveryClass`; no private `to_recovery` table).

Mapping highlights for the JMAP signals the central table reads:

- `Method(stateMismatch)` -> `ConcurrencyConflict` +
  `State(ConcurrencyConflict)` -> `Retry::AfterStateRefresh`.
- `Method(cannotCalculateChanges)` -> `SyncState(CursorInvalid)` ->
  `Engine(RestartScope)` when scope known, else `Engine(RestartAccount)`.
- `Method(serverUnavailable | serverFail | serverPartialFail)` ->
  `Server(Unavailable)` -> `Retry::SameRequest`;
  `Method(requestTooLarge | tooManyChanges)` -> `SyncState(CursorInvalid)`
  or `Request(Malformed)` by context.
- `Method(forbidden)` -> `Authorization(PermissionDenied)` ->
  `NoPermission`. For a foreign (shared) `Folder` scope,
  `shared_scope_error` intercepts this into `jmap_scope_revoked` ->
  `SyncState(ScopeRevoked)` -> `Engine(DisableScope(scope))` (quarantine
  one scope, not the account); a primary scope stays terminal.
- `Problem(limit)` -> `Server(RateLimited)` w/ `throttle_scope`;
  `Problem(unknownCapability)` -> `SyncState(CapabilityChanged)` ->
  `Engine(RestartAccount)`; `Problem(notJSON | notRequest)` ->
  `Protocol(ContractViolation)`. Bare-`Problem` HTTP fallbacks
  (401/403/429/5xx) map per the central rules.
- `Transport(_)` -> `Transport(Network)` with `AttemptCause::transmission_state` from where the wire failed; central mapping picks `Retry::SameRequest` for idempotent ops, `Reconcile` for non-idempotent ops caught mid-flight.
- WebSocket errors split by handshake position: `WebSocketHandshake`
  (pre-handshake) -> `Transport(Network)` + `Attempt(Unsent)`;
  `WebSocketRuntime` (post-handshake) -> `Protocol(PartialResponse)` +
  `Attempt(Acknowledged)`. No blanket `From<tokio_websockets::Error>`;
  call sites map explicitly.
- `NoPrimaryAccount` -> `Authentication(ReauthorizationRequired)` ->
  `AuthLost`. Local shape errors (`Parse`, `Set`, `CallNotFound`,
  `IdNotFound`, `EmptyResponse`, `NotParsable`, `InvalidUrl`) ->
  `Request(Malformed)` -> `ClientBug`.

Cursor-decode failures from `cursor::envelope` (protocol mismatch, unknown envelope, malformed payload) build their own AccountError with `SyncState(SchemaIncompatible)`, routed to `Engine(SchemaIncompatible)`.

Known JMAP `SetErrorType` vocabulary lands on typed
`WireCause::Jmap(JmapMethod::*)` variants. `SetErrorType::Other(code)` is
the only path to `JmapMethod::Unknown { code }`, carrying the actual wire
code (no synthesized `"other"` literal; string-matching unknown
vocabulary is forbidden by the gate-5 invariant).

`sync/error.rs` exposes two stream terminators: `terminated_unsupported`
(`Unsupported(op)`) and `terminated_contract_violation`
(`Protocol(ContractViolation)`, for pagination overflows and
response-shape mismatches). Both take the caller's `AccountOperation`.

### Foreign (shared/delegate) accounts

JMAP auto-discovers shared/delegate accounts from the session: at `open`, `foreign_mail_account_ids` selects session accounts with `isPersonal: false` advertising `urn:ietf:params:jmap:mail`, excluding the primary; each becomes a scoped `Account::new(client, accountId)` handle in `foreign_mail`. `seed_foreign_account` runs the primary's three probes (`Email`/`Mailbox`/`Thread` state) plus a `Mailbox/get` enumeration, inserting per-accountId `state_cache` entries and seeding one `CursorScope::Folder(encode_foreign(accountId, mailboxId))` per mailbox into `seed_states`. A successfully seeded foreign account that also advertises Submission is included in `foreign_submission`; only that same routing set enables `pim_methods.send_as`, so an account skipped by probing never produces an advertised but unreachable send path. A failed probe is skipped (others still open); cost is O(foreign accounts) round-trips at open.

Owner-email resolution for those accounts is a two-level RFC 9670 gate
(`owner_email_plans`): no session `urn:ietf:params:jmap:principals`
capability means no plans at all, and per account the
`...:principals:owner` capability supplies the principal id.
`Principal/get` is authoritative; the account name is only ever a
fallback, and a narrow one. `account_name_as_address` PARSES the name
rather than sniffing it for an `@`, accepting only a bare addr-spec with
a dotted domain - display-name forms like `Support <support@example.com>`
are rejected outright rather than having an address guessed out of them,
because a wrong owner is worse than no owner. `fetch_principal_email`
returns a three-way `PrincipalEmail` so a lookup that never completed is
distinguishable from one that completed with no address:
`owner_email_from_lookup` permits the name fallback only on `Absent`.
On `Unavailable` the owner email is left unset, so a transport blip or an
unimplemented `Principal/get` cannot overwrite real ownership with a
label.

The foreign accountId rides in the `Folder` scope's `FolderId` (`foreign.rs` codec, `\u{1f}` separator); `Type(_)` scopes cannot carry an account (`Type(Email)` is identical across accounts and would collide in the engine index), so the variant-free `Folder` shape is used. `mail_for_scope` / `account_id_for_scope` / `owner_of_scope` route a `Folder` scope to its `foreign_mail` handle, state-map key, and `MailboxId(accountId)` owner tag; primary scopes route to `self.mail` and `None`. `cursor_scopes` appends seeded foreign `Folder` scopes; `discover::memberships` appends one `Mailbox(accountId)` owner tag per foreign account, and `inventory_stream` stamps that tag onto every foreign-scope item so a foreign account's native mailbox ids cannot be conflated with the primary's in the membership index. The request layer is already per-account (`Account<Tr>::build` stamps the accountId), so routing is "hand `mail_for_scope` instead of `self.mail`", not a `core/request.rs` change.

Foreign OBJECT ids are qualified with the same codec (`encode_object` /
`parse_object` / `native_object`, same `\u{1f}` separator). The foreign
inventory qualifies both `InventoryEntry::id` and its whole-message
`blob_id`; the foreign changes leg qualifies its `ObjectChange` ids. This is
what makes hydration and blob reads self-routing: `get_stream` and
`open_blob` receive only an id - no scope - so a bare native id would run
`Email/get` / `/download/{accountId}/{blobId}` against the PRIMARY account
and either 404 or resolve an unrelated same-id primary object.
`hydrate::route_for_id` buckets ids per routing target (one `Email/get` per
account, since the call is accountId-scoped), strips to the native id on the
wire, and re-qualifies on the way out so an outcome id is byte-identical to
the id the caller handed in. `blob::foreign_split` does the same selection
for `open_blob` and both legs of `open_raw_rfc822` (the `blobId` fetch AND
the download). An id naming an account this session cannot reach falls back
to the primary handle deliberately, so the miss surfaces as a real
not-found rather than a fabricated local error.

`pim::message_hydrate` (the one-id door, and the one
`SyncEngine::message_hydrate` funnels into) routes on the SAME
`hydrate::route_for_id` decision. It previously did not, so a foreign-encoded
id reached the primary `Email/get` verbatim and came back as a `NotFound`
naming the encoded string. On the way out, `qualify_foreign_message_ids`
re-qualifies the hydrated `Message`: `id` and each attachment `BlobId` in the
OBJECT namespace (`encode_object`, what `open_blob` decodes), each
`ContainerId` in the FOLDER namespace (`encode_foreign`, what
`containers_list` and the cursor scopes key on). The two namespaces are not
interchangeable and the projection must not confuse them.

`thread_hydrate` is NOT routed, deliberately: foreign inventory never
qualifies `InventoryEntry::thread_id`, so there is no foreign-encoded thread
id in circulation to route. See the `nc-7` TODO - qualifying thread ids is a
contract change, not a wiring fix.

`containers_list` appends each foreign account's mailboxes with
`namespace = Shared`, `owner = MailboxId(accountId)`,
`native_id = encode_foreign(accountId, mailboxId)` (byte-identical to the
seeded `CursorScope::Folder` string), `owner_local_id` = the bare mailbox id,
and the parent re-encoded in the same namespace so a foreign child never
points at a same-id primary mailbox. A per-account `Mailbox/get` failure
degrades to a `Warning` plus the remaining containers. `containers_list` has
no warning lane in the `Account` trait and this crate carries no logging
dependency, so `fetch_foreign_containers` returns the structured `Warning`s
and the caller drops them; the load-bearing half (one unreachable share does
not blank the sidebar) is live regardless.

Out of A5a's read/sync slice (named follow-ups): foreign-account *mutations* (the `ifInState` cache is shaped for it via the per-accountId maps, but unwired - a mutation primitive handed a foreign-qualified id today would pass the whole encoded string to the primary account) and foreign *mailbox lifecycle* (the `scope_lifecycle` worker polls only the primary; a foreign mailbox added after `open` appears at the next reopen).

### Known limitations

- `Thread` and `Query` inventory are not implemented (fatal-unsupported); thread/query changes are supported.
- Foreign bulk mutations and live foreign-mailbox lifecycle are not wired. `get_stream` / `open_blob` / `open_raw_rfc822` DO route to the foreign account (via the qualified object-id codec); the mutation primitives do not. Foreign submission is supported, but scheduled foreign submission is not.
- Raw-MIME projections unsupported; only `FlagsOnly` and `Metadata` work. Push is WebSocket-subprotocol only (no HTTP/EventSource fallback).
- `BlobRangeSupport::No`; `open_blob_range` fatals `Error::Unsupported` even when the handle advertises range support (no transport `Range` hook).
- `MutationReplaySafety::None`; `IdempotencyKey` is a wire no-op (read-back guard is the only lost-update protection).
- `bulk_move` only `MembershipScope::Mailbox`; `inventory_partitioning` only `Page { from, to }` for `Email`.
- Gmail labels, Graph categories/extended properties, and identity-default selection are unsupported. Attachment handles keep blob id + MIME but not uploaded filenames.
- Typed filter-rule CRUD is unsupported; JMAP exposes literal Sieve scripts instead.
