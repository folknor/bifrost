# TODO

## What belongs here, and what does not

This file holds OPEN work: defects to fix, decisions the repository owner
has not made, and ruled work that has not landed. Nothing else.

- **A completed item is DELETED**, never annotated DONE or CLOSED. Its
  "what" is in the code and `reference/`; its "why" is in git history.
- **A known limit, an accepted non-defect, a deliberate trade, a coverage
  boundary, or a "do not re-file this" marker does NOT go here.** It goes
  to an inline comment at the code it describes - the function, constant,
  match arm or test whose behaviour it explains - written so the next
  reader of that code understands the limit, why it is accepted, and what
  would change it. Where a consumer relies on it, it is also stated in the
  crate's `reference/` doc. A bullet in this file is invisible from the
  code, and every past close-out has had to move such bullets there by
  hand; put them there directly.
- **A rejected proposal gets the same treatment**: a comment at the code
  the proposal would have changed, stating the ruling and its condition
  for re-raising. Code comments never cite `notes/` paths.
- Verify every item against the code before working it. This file has no
  truth guarantee; `reference/` and passing tests are authoritative and a
  finding that contradicts them loses. Fix only what is named and
  confirmed; a change that removes or renames a published item stops and
  asks the owner, whatever the argument. A shared-crate change (`types`,
  `net`, `sasl`, `sync`) is verified with the full-workspace `brokkr
  check`, never `-p`.
- An existing test you must modify is a red flag; justify it explicitly.

The order below is a priority triage of the findings taken at face value,
not verified against the code. Verification happens when an item is worked.

## 1. Priority

Items that leak something or report success for something that did not
happen, plus one surface gap that matters if the consumer relies on it.

- **`SyncEngine` exposes almost no calendar primitives.** It forwards contact
  primitives, but of the calendar `Account` methods only `event_delete` and
  `event_delete_if_version` (`crates/sync/src/engine/passthrough.rs`). List,
  range, get, create, update, RSVP and search have no passthrough, and
  `event_rsvp_if_version` needs one too:
  `pub async fn event_rsvp_if_version(&self, account_id: &AccountId, event: EventId, status: RsvpStatus, expected_version: Option<ServerVersion>) -> Result<(), Error>`.
  An omission only if the engine is meant to be the consumer's single door
  for calendar, as it is for contacts.

## 2. Blocked on a live probe

Nothing hermetic can settle these.

- **Google `events_in_range` combines `orderBy=startTime` with
  `showDeleted=true`.** `crates/google/src/account/calendar.rs`. Google's docs
  bless `showDeleted=true` with `singleEvents=true`, and `orderBy=startTime`
  requires `singleEvents=true`, but there are long-standing reports of the live
  API answering 400 "The requested ordering is not available for the particular
  query" for some `showDeleted` + `orderBy` combinations, and cancelled
  instances have no `start` to order by (only `originalStartTime`, which the
  projection substitutes). If Google rejects the combination, every production
  range read fails: top severity if real.
- **Graph directory search: the alias `$select` may cost directory reach.**
  `otherMails` and `proxyAddresses` sit outside the property set
  `User.ReadBasic.All` grants, as do `businessPhones`, `companyName`,
  `jobTitle` and `department`. A tenant holding only basic directory consent
  may now 403 the WHOLE `/users` query where it previously succeeded. It maps
  to `NoPermission` correctly, but a tenant with working directory search can
  lose it. Confirming needs a live ReadBasic-only tenant. If it fires, the fix
  is a select-narrowing retry after the first 403 (narrow all properties
  outside the basic set and re-issue), NOT dropping them from the query, which
  would give every tenant the degraded projection.
- **Graph event delta without `$select` may not return `changeKey`.** Event
  inventory and changes pages no longer send `$select` (Graph documents it as
  unsupported on event delta) and receive Graph's default delta property set.
  If that set omits `changeKey` or `recurrence`, the event fingerprint degrades
  to `Unavailable`.

## 3. Blocked on downstream

- **Retire `RATATOSKR_TEST_GCAL_ENDPOINT`.**
  `GoogleAccountFactory::with_calendar_api_base` exists and takes precedence.
  The environment variable was KEPT on purpose: `ratatoskr` and `sæhrimnir`
  both set it, and deleting it would not fail their builds - it would silently
  point their test traffic at the real Google Calendar API. Once both have
  migrated, delete `default_calendar_base` and have the constructors take
  `CALENDAR_API_BASE` directly. That removes the last `std::env::var` read in
  the workspace and the last place a bifrost crate names a downstream
  consumer.

## 4. Owner rulings

Product, API-shape and error-model decisions. None is a live defect on its
face.

### Error model and published surface

- **An IMAP send with no acknowledged recipient but an uncertain one is `Err`.**
  `send_rfc5322` (`crates/imap/src/account/submission.rs`) returns the uncertain
  lane's error (InFlight evidence, `Application::Uncertain`) when nothing landed
  in the succeeded lane, and the call skips the Sent APPEND and, for
  `draft_send`, the draft discard, although the message may have been accepted.
  A consumer dispatching on `error.recovery()` alone can also get terminal
  advice: a malformed final reply in that lane is `ProviderContractViolation`.
  The other recipients' failures are dropped from that `Err`. Decide whether
  "acceptance uncertain, none acknowledged" becomes a receipt state, and if so
  what Sent filing and draft cleanup do for a maybe-sent message.
- **Only IMAP fills `SendReceipt::recipients_not_accepted`.** JMAP decodes
  `EmailSubmission.deliveryStatus` (`crates/jmap/src/email_submission/`) but the
  send path in `crates/jmap/src/sync/pim.rs` never reads it; Gmail and Graph
  expose no per-recipient answer. Decide whether JMAP should populate the field
  from `deliveryStatus` (its `smtpReply` per recipient is the same evidence).

- **Gmail and Graph ignore `save_to_sent = false`.** Both file the Sent copy
  server-side unconditionally (`_save_to_sent` is unused in
  `crates/google/src/account/pim.rs` and `crates/graph/src/account/pim/send.rs`),
  and their `SendReceipt` says `ProviderManaged`. Decide whether a declined Sent
  copy should be refused as `Unsupported`, honoured by a post-send delete, or
  documented as a provider limit on `SendRequest::save_to_sent`.
- **`SendReceipt::id` multiplexes three identities.** It is a message id, a
  scheduled-send handle (JMAP returns the EmailSubmission id when scheduled), or
  an IMAP `imapmsgid1:` correlation token that names no addressable object.
  Separate fields (message id, correlation id, scheduled handle) would let
  `cancel_scheduled_send` / `reschedule_send` take the handle by type. Also
  `draft_send` has no per-call `save_to_sent`; IMAP uses the account default.
- **A JMAP send's leftover staging Email has no routable handle on the
  receipt.** When the implicit `Email/set` refuses or does not confirm the
  Sent move, the created/imported Email (or, for `draft_send`, the submitted
  draft, which now looks sendable) may remain in Drafts with `$draft`; when it
  refuses or does not confirm the `save_to_sent = false` destroy, the staging
  Email may survive. The receipt says `NotFiled` / `Uncertain` / `NotRequested`
  and the destroy case is only logged (`implicit_sent_copy` in
  `crates/jmap/src/sync/pim.rs`). Reusing `DraftDiscardFailure` was rejected:
  no discard was attempted on the move path, and `draft_discard` routes only
  through the primary draft account, so a foreign send-as staging Email cannot
  be addressed by a `DraftHandle`. Decide whether `SendReceipt` grows a field
  naming the retained or possibly retained Email with an owner-preserving
  handle, distinguishing refused, uncertain and failed-destroy.
- **A proxy 407 maps to `AuthLost`, implying the wrong remedy.** JMAP
  classifies net's typed `TunnelError` (407 ->
  `Authentication(ReauthorizationRequired)` / `AuthLost`, proxy TLS ->
  `Transport(Tls)`, other refusals by status). The error model has no
  proxy-credential kind, so a 407 asks the consumer to reauthorize the mail
  account when the proxy's credentials are wrong; only support detail says so.
  Decide whether the taxonomy gains a proxy-credential kind or a different
  existing kind fits better.
- **`MutationConcurrency::StateBased` has no producer left.** Keep or remove
  is the owner's decision, to be made later. JMAP, CalDAV, CardDAV and Graph
  moved off it, so no provider advertises it. The `IdempotencyKey` doc in
  `crates/types/src/mutation.rs` still contrasts itself with `StateBased` as
  "optimistic concurrency on the wire".
- **Engine-internal requests on the published `ReopenRequest`.**
  `ScopeDeleted`, `ScopeCreated`, `EstablishIfAbsent` and `SchemaReset` are
  engine plumbing whose epochs and generations mean nothing to a consumer, on
  a `pub` enum re-exported from `lib.rs`. Moving them to a crate-private
  request enum removes published variants. Same ruling: `PushRecovery` is now
  identical in meaning to `Recovery { generation: Some(_) }` (both are
  stamped with the producing incarnation's generation and declined the same
  way), so merging it into `Recovery` also removes a published variant.
- **Caller-version residue.** Ruled (2026-10-21) and largely landed. Still
  open: JMAP PIM reads expose no caller type-state field, so a consumer has
  nothing to hand back, although JMAP capabilities already advertise
  `ExpectedVersion` on those doors (advertising an unusable guarantee is a
  product question); IMAP versioned flag writes are still submitted per
  target; other mutation families have no caller-version surface.
- **BulkDestroy PartialResponse derives DedupeByClientId** even though destroy
  has no client-id deduplication. This protects Graph/JMAP's usual ambiguous
  destroy answers from reassertion. An operation-aware derivation requires an
  error-model ruling. The same derivation now reaches the JMAP single-id
  doors that read an unanswered set id as `PartialResponse`: an unanswered
  `CancelScheduledSend`, the `RescheduleSend` cancel leg (no replacement
  create was attempted), `ContainerDelete`, `FilterDelete` and `DraftDiscard`
  all carry `DedupeByClientId`. A reschedule-only partial-commit record with a
  `Cancelled` Uncertain primary would drop it there, but was not built ahead
  of the general ruling.
- **A dedupe-bearing stream termination leaves same-round per-item
  SameRequest/AfterAuthRefresh blind retry candidates eligible.** Whether
  whole-submission dedupe should suppress these retries needs a ruling.

### Write outcomes and compensation

- **Acknowledged single-request creates without a usable identity can invite
  a duplicating manual retry:** IMAP draft_create without APPENDUID, Google
  People contact_create without resourceName, standalone Graph draft_create,
  Google and Graph filter_create, and Google calendar event_create. The
  committed-unidentified partial-commit shape can carry them without inventing
  uncertainty.
- **IMAP container operations return a refresh_folders failure after the
  write commits.** The partial-commit record makes this honest; whether to
  return success with a stale registry is a separate API decision.
- **Graph send_message leaves an orphan draft after a refused send;** each
  automatic retry can create another. Accepted Repeatable clutter, bounded by
  retry budgets. Orphan cleanup would be a new compensation; none exists in
  `pim/send.rs`.
- **Graph cancel_upload_session records a 404 or 410 as a Failed
  compensation,** though both mean the session is already gone. Google treats
  404, 410 and 499 on its cancel as Succeeded. Decide whether Graph should
  match.
- **Mutation outcomes carry no per-id detail.**
  `MutationCounters::pending_retry` is a single count that lumps unsent work,
  exhausted retries, read-back mismatches and inconclusive read-backs, with no
  object ids. A consumer that wants to replay or report precisely can only
  re-run the whole campaign.

### Engine behaviour

- **Push terminal event semantics.** A terminal push unit failure broadcasts
  account-scoped `SyncEvent::Terminated` while polling continues; its error
  carries the failing unit's attribution. Decide whether this needs a distinct
  structured notification; a folder-scoped termination could incorrectly imply
  that folder polling died. Matters if a consumer UI reads it as "account
  dead".
- **Push and lifecycle pause policy.** Lifecycle streams continue polling
  while the account boundary is paused; the multiplexer owns their pacing but
  does not consult the boundary. Push sessions gate only directive submission;
  registration maintenance may need to keep server watches alive, while
  Connection lanes retain live transports. Decide their pause semantics
  together.
- **Scope disable and push subscriptions.** DisableScope quarantines a cursor
  but does not narrow desired push subscriptions. An IMAP folder excluded after
  SELECT refusal remains in the subscription registry until consumer
  unsubscribe or account replacement. Decide whether engine scope quarantine
  should also change desired coverage.
- **Uncertain mutation items carrying Engine recovery are observed but do not
  forward the directive** (`classify_item_outcome` in sync engine bulk). The
  reassertion path protects these ids; forwarding is separate work.

### New capability

- **Caller-supplied composition `Date` on `SendRequest`.** The shared
  renderer stamps `Date:` with the submission instant. An offline outbox that
  submits later would want the moment the user pressed Send instead; a
  `SendRequest` field (defaulting to now) would carry it. Surfaced by the
  codex spar on bz#1; not built because it is a new consumer-facing knob.
- **Gmail `draft_send` and `Date`.** Google drafts are rendered without a
  `Date` and handed to drafts.send as stored. If a live probe shows Gmail
  keeps a missing `Date` missing in the sent copy, `draft_send` could fetch
  the draft and pass replacement `message.raw` stamped with the send time
  in the same drafts.send call.

- **Graph contact moves.** `crates/graph/src/account/contacts.rs`. A folder
  change is refused as `Unsupported(ContactUpdate)` before I/O. Supporting it
  means folder-aware move routing (Graph lists `parentFolderId` as an update
  field).

- **Graph public-folder mail writes over EWS.** `crates/graph/src/account/mutate.rs`,
  `pim/messages.rs`. Flag writes, moves, destroys and the typed writers refuse
  public-folder items as `Unsupported` before I/O, because Graph REST cannot
  address them and the EWS client has no write operations. Building it means an
  EWS arm (`UpdateItem` for `IsRead` / `Flag` / `Categories`, `MoveItem`,
  `DeleteItem`) routed by the folder's `routing_map` headers, with change-key
  preconditions, replacement ids after a move, etag-cache and ambiguous-
  completion handling that meet the mutation contracts, and a capability
  story for a namespace-specific write gap. Not built: nobody has ruled
  public folders writable.
- **Undiscovered public-folder move destinations.** A public folder id is a
  bare EWS `FolderId`; only discovery (`is_known_public_folder`) tells it
  apart from a primary folder id, so a move into an undiscovered public
  folder still goes to Graph REST and fails there.

## 5. Low priority

Narrow edge cases, audits with no known defect, and design work.

- **IMAP search: one failing folder fails the whole page.** `search` and
  `search_messages` (`crates/imap/src/account/pim.rs`) propagate any
  per-folder SELECT or SEARCH error with `?` across every selectable folder,
  shared ones included, and never use `Page::skipped_scopes`; Graph
  quarantines a revoked mailbox instead. Needs a ruling on which per-folder
  failures quarantine rather than fail.
- **IMAP search: the ESEARCH expansion cap is reported as `Request(Malformed)`.**
  `SearchResultTruncated` (`crates/imap/src/account/error.rs`) maps to a
  `ClientBug` class although the request was well formed and the server
  answered correctly; a caller cannot tell "criteria malformed" from "result
  too large" except by support-only text. Position paging does not help, since
  every page call still expands the whole folder result.
- **IMAP search cursor is not bound to its query.** The `imapsearch1:` cursor
  carries only a position, so it is accepted for a different `SearchRequest`.
  A position is meaningful under any query, so this resumes rather than
  corrupts, but JMAP and Graph bind their search cursors to owner and state.

- **IMAP PIM partial-commit scopes name the canonical id, not the submitted
  one.** `folder_effect_targets` (`crates/imap/src/account/pim.rs`) rebuilds
  `ErrorScope::Message` from a `FolderEffect`'s folder, UIDVALIDITY and UID,
  and `copy_messages`, `delete_messages` and `set_flag` reduce their decoded
  targets to numeric UIDs via `valid_uids`, so a legacy `imap1` or
  non-canonical source id is reported in its `imap2` spelling. Batch lanes and
  hydration already echo the submitted id; no in-workspace consumer matches
  these diagnostic scopes against submitted ids (sync attributes partial
  commits by the enclosing `BatchItemId`), so this is attribution polish.
  Fixing it means carrying `DecodedObjectId::id` through `FolderEffect`; new
  destination ids stay canonical.

- **JMAP create-id omissions still classify as terminal `MissingField`.**
  `SetResponse::created` answers a create-id in neither `created` nor
  `notCreated` with `Error::IdNotFound`, which the generic translation makes
  `Protocol(MissingField)`; the create may have landed. Readers: filter create
  (`sync/filters.rs`), event and contact create, and the `sync/pim.rs` send,
  draft, import and replacement-submission creates. Several wrap it in their
  own partial-commit handling (reschedule's `replacement_error` raises it to
  `Uncertain`), so each needs a case-by-case check before giving `created`
  the `SetIdUnanswered` treatment `updated` / `destroyed` now have. Distinct
  from a returned created object that lacks its server id, which is a
  confirmed create with an unusable identity.
- **Consumer-injected terminations cannot be attributed to an incarnation.**
  `InvalidationSink::push` (`route_watch_event` in
  `crates/sync/src/push/mod.rs`) sends `ReopenRequest::Recovery` with
  `generation: None` by policy, so a delayed termination from an obsolete
  external watch (a webhook or Pub/Sub subscription the consumer runs) still
  restarts, resets or disables the replacement after a reattach. Closing it
  needs optional incarnation attribution on the consumer-facing push API
  (`WatchEvent` or `SinkPush` side) while keeping the unattributed door;
  sampling the current generation at push time was rejected, since it labels
  an old event with the new identity.
- **Lifecycle `Renamed` can lose its create half.** Deleting the old scope can
  remove the last registered folder cursor, after which
  `membership_to_cursor_scopes` finds no shape for the new membership and
  raises no `ScopeCreated`. Pre-existing.
- **`ScopeCreated` listener arm has no end-to-end test.**
  `created_lifecycle_requests_establishment_only_if_absent` pins only the
  multiplexer's routing; a listener arm that restarted a registered scope
  would pass it. Nor do tests independently pin the lifecycle, bulk or
  deferred-inventory stamp attribution (the listener decline and the
  reconciler stamp are pinned).
- **Push reconciler awaits `reopen_tx` with no shutdown arm.** The
  `ReopenRequest::Recovery` send in `crates/sync/src/push/reconciler.rs` is a
  bare `.await`, unlike every other engine producer (bulk campaigns, deferred
  inventory, parked repairs, push lanes), which select against shutdown. Not
  traced: whether its scheduler admission permit or any activity guard is still
  held at that await. If either is, it has the pause cycle the bulk campaign
  sends had (serial listener parked in `wait_until_running`, full channel).
- **IMAP connect-time STARTTLS expiry carries no evidence.** `setup_timeout`
  in `crates/imap/src/connection/lifecycle.rs` maps every connect-time expiry
  to `Error::Timeout { attempt: None }`, including one after the STARTTLS
  tagged OK or the stream swap. Harmless today (the half-built session is
  dropped before a driver exists and the only recovery is a fresh dial), but
  it is the one transition path whose error states no phase.
- **Session cap does not span account incarnations.** A failed or cancelled
  factory open, or a closing incarnation during reopen, can leave a transport
  tail that the next incarnation's cap does not count.
- **IMAP push: same-session NOTIFY extension is uncovered until
  registration.** In the Reidle branch, a newly added folder is watched only
  after the re-issued NOTIFY SET. Changes before registration are not
  invalidated.
- **IMAP literals are not emitted incrementally.** FETCH body and binary
  literals are `Bytes` slices of the framed response, but a FETCH response is
  fully framed and parsed before delivery. Standalone parsers without an owned
  backing still copy, generic string fields still parse owned, and non-literal
  syntax and parser overhead are outside the literal ceiling. Incremental
  delivery needs a chunk-aware parser and dispatch contract: design work,
  suggested for the technical-specification track.
- **Account schema reset follow-ups.**
  - `BackfillCheckpointWriter::persist` bypasses completion refusal and every
    reset fence: the attached route accepts any consumer-supplied
    `BackfillCheckpoint`, completion partition included, with no publication;
    the direct route has no engine at all. The account reset excludes this
    consumer assertion path.
  - Ledger-only writer requests from pre-reset producers: `RecordBarrier` and
    `CrossWaivedBarriers` sent by a walk that predates a scope or account
    reset are accepted; a stale barrier fails closed (it blocks the
    replacement walk and asks an operator) and needs its own policy.
    `RecordDebt` acceptance is the safe direction and stays.
  - Schema-incompatibility evidence discarded before classification: a
    lifecycle `Created` restart deletes a preexisting row unread;
    `run_establish` types an unreadable row as `Engine(SchemaIncompatible)`
    without routing it to the account reset, and the per-scope retry loop
    treats it as retryable. Reachable for a preexisting row of a scope absent
    from discovery at attach that returns mid-session before any sibling door
    failure.
  - Per-scope fences do not refuse foreign publications: the account fence
    refuses ids minted by earlier attachments; per-scope resets still accept a
    prior attachment's change receipt through the fallback.
  - Duplicate SchemaIncompatible directives run duplicate account resets:
    every scope whose door fails sends its own directive, and each runs a full
    clear and re-establishment, for directives already queued by distinct live
    drives.
  - `ack_checkpoint` with no publication bypasses every fence: a change cursor
    or backfill page acknowledged with `publication: None` skips the claim
    lookup and every reset fence in `persist_ack_request`; after an account
    reset such a backfill page becomes a resume position past windows the
    replacement walk never re-mints. Nothing in the engine sends one. Two
    answers to rule on: name it as a consumer assertion path, or refuse a
    `None`-publication backfill acknowledgement (always, by the reasoning
    `completion_refusal` already records, or once an account fence is raised).
  - Conditional registration ignores `fenced_backfill`: `register_if_fence`
    compares `scope_fence`, which reads `fenced` (and `fenced_account`), not
    `fenced_backfill`, so a backfill discard revokes an in-flight backfill
    producer only at acknowledgement, not at registration. Probably harmless
    (the discard runs before the retry mints).
  - Backfill discard requests survive an account reset: detach drains
    `take_backfill_discards()` and sends `DiscardBackfillProgress` per scope; a
    discard recorded before an account reset deletes the post-reset walk's rows
    at detach. Safe direction (costs a re-walk).
  - Capture the lifecycle epoch where `Created` is raised: routing it as
    `EstablishIfAbsent { scope, epoch }` read at the multiplexer, instead of a
    synthesized `RestartScope` whose park reads the epoch at decline time,
    would let the epoch alone distinguish "deleted before the repair was
    raised" from "recreated". Changes the routing an existing multiplexer test
    pins.

## Coverage gaps from the October 2026 hunt

Not findings; areas the hunt did not reach in depth, for the next pass.

- Graph: public-folder EWS, autodiscover, cloud upload and search.
- Sync: `cursor/coverage.rs`, `cursor/ledger.rs`, `cursor/ledger_envelope.rs`,
  `backfill/*`, `engine/lane.rs` and `repair.rs`, the largest files.
